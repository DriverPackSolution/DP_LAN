  Introduction
  컴컴컴컴컴컴
       Windows XP provides a complete "Plug n' Play" System that will
       automatically recognize and configure most PC Cards.

       Before inserting your LanModem PC Card, the system's PCMCIA chipset
       must be enabled and functioning. The PCMCIA chipset is responsible
       for controlling the systems interface for PC Cards. Please consult
       the system's manual or manufacture for use with Windows XP.

       Multifunction PC Cards put a heavy demand on a system's resources.
       Please resolve all system conflicts, errors, and Windows XP issues
       before installing the LanModem.

       Please have the installation media for the Windows XP ready for
       any request for files.

  Getting Started

       With the system off, remove all PC Cards

       Insert the Installation diskette into floppy disk drive.

       Insert the LanModem into one of the system's PCMCIA Slots

       After starting Windows XP, the PCMCIA will be detected automatically,
        then the Found New Hardware Wizard window appears.

        Click the Next button in the Install Hardware Device Drivers window.
         Windows XP will start to search floppy drive A for network driver.

       Because the device is multifunction, the system will repeat
        the "Found New Hardware" a few times. Please repeat the same
        steps for each request made by the system.

       Click Continue Anyway button, then the Windows XP starts to copy the
        driver to the user's hard disk.

       Click Finish button.
