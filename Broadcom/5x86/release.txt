Version 15.2.0.4  May 24, 2012
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ62053 - EEE ungracefully reset after resuming from S4 on W2K3.
      Cause:
        When EEE is disabled in nvram, NCSI clears the EEE advertisement setting in GPHY during system resuming from S4.
      Change:
        Make driver to set the EEE advertisement setting and restart the Auto-Negotiation.
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ62747 - 57766 Cable Analysis test failed when testing via Remote Desktop Connection(RDC).
        CQ62751 - By using RDC to configure BACS 57766 ASF enable/disable parameter will result in error.
      Cause:
        The CQ51828 woarkound causes device to run at slower clock and that makes BMAPI get time-out
        for waiting ASF to be loaded and running.
      Change:
        Disable CQ51828 woarkound when ASF is enabled.
      Impact:
        None.

  3.  Problem:
        CQ63445 - 5761 system see the  error message in Windbg for STU running WinXP with SP3.
      Cause:
        The error message is about mapping physical memory that it does not own.
        This mapping is needed for driver to read this area of BIOS for iscsi boot info.
      Change:
        The OEM does not use iscsi with 5761B0 NIC. So we makde driver not to map to this memory area
        when the driver is loaded with particular OEM system with 5761.
      Impact:
        None.

----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ60621 - 57762:EEE not functioning properly - Power stays high after traffic removed
      Cause:
        CPMU relies on several hw detection methods to decide whether or not to enter/exit EEE Mode,
        "TXMBUF = 0" is one of it. After some traffic with MMRR enable, it may causes the TXMBUF Count to never go to zero.
        TXMBUF Idle detection logic needs to be updated when the MMRR architecture is added in 57762/57766.  
      Change:
        Workaround: mask this error detection bug by clearing bit 3 of register 0x36BC.
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ60966 - b57diag "sechksum" will get failure on "2nd Boot Code" when boot to OS and loaded driver.

      Cause:
        The LED mode is not correct when system entering S3/S4 with "Lowest WOL Speed" setting.
      Change:      
        Set bit_12:11 (LED Mode) of reg 0x40c to 11 (same as PHY mode 1) so LED can get correct color when link is 10Mbps in S3/S4.
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ59676 - Running chariot with Jumbo frame enable and then disable device will cause system BSOD.
      Cause:
        Driver optimized code "adjust the rx buffer so that packet payload begins at a 64-byte boundary"
        is causing device to write outside driver allocated DMA buffer
      Change:      
        Remove the optimized code.
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ55935 - OEM reports that NMI will happen after manually crash the system.
      Cause:
        The API RtlCopyMemory() driver uses to copy the data from device's internal memory to host memory
        (allocated for crash dump) is generating illegal memory read cycle that makes system get NMI.
      Change:
        Use alternative way to copy the data from device's internal memory to the buffer for crash dump.
      Impact:
        None.
        
  3.  Problem:
        CQ55277 - WinFWUpg v7.0.43: 5720 (M45PE40) after upg ncsi run crc will failed in "APE fw" and "iscsi cfg prog".

  2.  Problem:
        CQ54559 - Rx discards stat increments when dropping undesirable multicast frames.
      Cause:
        The counter increments because multicast frames are being rejected by the APE, 
        which increases the counter.
      Change:
        Implement an alternative strategy where the driver counts the number of times 
        rx mbuf resources are unavailable.
      Impact:
        The workaround grossly approximates the original function of the counter, 
        but not exactly. This bug only affects 5717/5718, 5719 A0, and 5720 A0.

----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ54066 - Need multiple Magic packets to wake system from S3/S4/S5 in Fiber mode.
      Cause: 
        The wire clock is much faster than the TLP clock in Fiber mode. 
        As a result, it fails to capture the WOL event.
      Change:
        Bootocde v1.05 has a workaround to derive TLP clock from NCSI PLL when system is running on VAUX.
        Make driver not to halt RX CPU during S3/S4/S5, so bootcode can execute the workaround successfully.
      Note:

        Driver doesn¡¦t set consistent value to Receive MTU Size Reg (0x43c) and MAX_Frame_Size (located in RCB
        for Std Ring Reg 0x2458). The MTU Reg is used by EMAC to determine if device is going to receive or drop 
        the packet. Max Frame Size is used for device to determine if the packet goes to standard ring or jumbo
        ring (by WDMA). For this particular case, ¡§ping xxxx ¡Vl 1473¡¨ will actually generate a packet with length
        1519 (1473 + 42 header + 4 CRC). This packet will be received by device, but device is unable to do WDMA 
        for this packet, because jumbo ring is not enabled. Then the packet makes device unable to receive packet
        anymore (even with standard size packet).

        Make inf change as request to remove EEE from driver advanced properties.
      Impact:
        For 57765/57785 family devices only.


Version 14.2.0.5  May 21, 2010
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ47563 - After resuming from S3, enabled/disable DASH fw through bmcc command cause SUT system abnormal.
      Cause:
        Driver is not aware that DASH is enabled/disabled at runtime, so driver can't make APE status update for
        correct driver state.
      Change:
        Implement new change for driver make APE status update for driver state change. Also, driver needs BMAPI
        (v7.19.0 and after) to suspend/resume driver after DASH has been enabled/disabled, then driver will have
        chance to reread NIC configuration (shared memory 0xb58 bit_7) for determining if DASH is enabled or not.
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Problem:
        1c_oidswmi test in NDISTest6.0 fails with v14.2.0.4 under XP-x86 and 2k3-x64.
      Cause:
        Test is unable to query the data for GUID added for Broadcom APE WMI Event.
      Change:
        Add flag in NDIS_GUID structure to map a GUID to a customized OID and add the customized OID
        support in MiniportQueryInformation() so that test can query the data successfully.
      Impact:
        None.

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        Support Sawtooth APE NCSI.


Version 14.2.0.4  Apr 30, 2010
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        Driver's crash dump function doesn't work with Windows XP SP2.
      Cause:
        Driver uses the function KeTestSpinLock() to determine if it's the OS that driver should support for
        crash dump function. However, KeTestSpinLock() is available on Windows 2003 or later version, but
        it's not exported in Windows XP, this makes driver fail to register the BugCheckCallback routine.
      Change:
        Change the method to make crash dump function work for the OS that driver supports.
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ47248 - Dash/ASF packets wakes up the system when XP enables WOL in the OS
      Change:
        Pass the WOL patterns to DASH firmware and let DASH firmware to handle WOL.
      Impact:
        Need to use DASH firmware V1.42.0.0 or later version.

  3.  Problem:
        CQ46602 - 57765 traffic broken when running chariot TX at 100M with jumbo enabled
      Cause:
        A control bit to enable/disable the Hw fix for CQ12429 is unexpectedly cleared by driver.
      Change:
        Enable the control bit back for fixing TxMBUF Lockup issue.
      Impact:
        None.

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        WMI event notification for 5761 DASH firmware.
      Change:
        The request is to enable immediate graceful power control and other remote management features in 5761.
        The DASH firmware will generate an interrupt to the host. The driver will not be able to tell from the
        status block that the interrupt is from the DASH firmware. So as part of the interrupt handling the
        driver will need to query register 0x6810 (RX CPU Event). If bit 0 (SW Event 0) is set then the driver
        will generate an WMI Event. Afterwards the driver will need to zero out this bit.
      Impact:
        The change works with 5761 with DASH firmware v1.42 or later.


Version 14.2.0.3  Apr 09, 2010
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        The "Last Driver State" (shared memory 0xC04) is incorrect when driver is unloaded with no WOL.
      Change:
        Fix the code error to make driver report correct state when it's unloaded.
      Impact:
        None.

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        Add the following changes in driver in order to support customer who uses OTP implementation.
        1) Driver needs to set bit 31 in register PCIE Physical Layer Register 0x1814 to disable clkreq in L2 to
           workaround a chipset bug.
        2) Driver needs to clear bits [9:7] of PCIE Configuration Space in Function 0 Register 0x6C.
           This is needed to ensure the SD Host Controller does not lock up.
        3) LAN Driver needs to force the Core Clock to 6.25MHz when the Ethernet Link is in 10Mb mode.
           This is needed in order to workaround a Hardware synchronization issue in the DMA Read Engine to
           prevent Fatal Error from stopping the transmitting logic.
      Note: the changes are for 57765/57785 family devices only


Version 14.2.0.2  Apr 02, 2010
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ46628 - WinFwUpg is unable to upgrade bootcode for 5718.
      Cause:
        Driver is not using the correct nvram strapping for recognizing the flash devices.
      Change:
        Update the nvram strapping map for the flash devices used by 5718.
      Impact:
        None

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        CQ44978 - Use *ReceiveBuffers registry key for NDIS6.x and NDIS5.x driver.

        Replace the registry keys with MSFT definition keys.
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Request:
        CQ46736 - remove fix for CQ39683, CQ40054 from Windows drivers (ndis5, Ndis6)
      Change:
        Make changes as request. These fixes may cause PCIE Serdes corruptions that result in
        device disappearances when the system resumes from S4 (CQ46606). These fixes are
        removed from driver and added into OTP selfboot.
      Impact:
        It's for 57780/57760 family devices only.


Version 14.2.0.1  Mar 10, 2010
----------------------------------------
  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        Enable Sawtooth bit16, 17, 18 in reg 0x70 for bmapi diag tests.
      Impact:
        None.


Version 14.2.0.0  Feb 25, 2010
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ45854 - BrcmMgmtAgent causing audio glitch during audio playout.
      Cause:
        The read/write NVRAM OIDs acquired a spin lock which made them run on irq dispatch level.
      Change:
        Remove the unnecessary spin lock for these OIDs.
      Impact:
        None.

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        CQ45484 - b57driver needs to add support for 5724.
      Change:
        The previous change in v14.0.0.6 is incomplete. Not only 2 parts IDs in inf files,
        Driver needs to make other changes to work with 5724.
        ex. Get ASIC revison from correct offset based on 5724's device ID.
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Request:
        Restore CQ45685, CQ46108 changes for 14.2 driver release
      Change:
        Make inf change as request.
      Note:
        CQ45685 - Remove EEE from driver advanced properties for the 14.0 Gold driver
        CQ46108 - Remove Sawtooth Support from 14.0 Driver


Version 14.0.0.7A  Feb 22, 2010
----------------------------------------
  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        CQ46108 - Remove Sawtooth Support from 14.0 Driver
      Impact:
        None.


Version 14.0.0.7  Feb 09, 2010
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ45796 - 57781/57765 no link after system resume from S1/S3 mode with SB code.
      Change:
        We have an issue in the SB ROM code which require a 10ms delay after seeing the
        reset signature (~KevT) in Shared Memory 0xB50 to workaround the issue.
      Impact:
        None.


Version 14.0.0.6  Feb 05, 2010
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
       CQ45244 - Link Flaps when EEE is enabled on SUT2, but not on SUT1
      Cause:
        Some bits in EeeMode reg are set by default
      Change:
       disabled all EEE related bits in EeeMode reg and clear PHY 1000TX/100Base-Tx EEE advertise
       for Sawtooth if EEE mode is not enable.

  2.  Problem:
       CQ45444 - Tx NQS is filtering packets when opcode does match for TCP Payloads.
      Cause:
       For element filter Element-Header 4 "Start of TCP/UDP Payload, else IP Payload, else Ethernet Payload",
       the current driver design will check on both TCP payload and IP payload and filter out the packet if
       any one of them matches.
      Change:
        Make driver's TX NQS filter works like device's RX NQS filter - when packet contains IP payload and TCP payload,
        driver will examine NQS filter against TCP or UDP payload only.
      Impact:
        None.

  3.  Problem:
        CQ45666 - 57765x-system hanged when run Diagnostic test at 100MF/100MH with ASF enabled
      Cause:
        During MAC loopback test in BACS diagnostic testing, there is a racing condition which causes
        driver to free a spin lock which is not acquired yet. The deadlock makes system hang.
      Change:
        Make code change to prevent driver running into the racing condition.
      Impact:
        None.

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        CQ45418 - Add 4 part ID support for specific OEM.

      Change:
        Added IDs
      Impact:
        None.

  3.  Request:
        CQ45484 - Sawtooth:b57driver need to add b5724 support.
      Change:
        Added IDs
      Impact:
        None.

  4.  Request:
        CQ45685 - Remove EEE from driver advanced properties for the 14.0 Gold driver
      Change:
        Make inf change as request to remove EEE from driver advanced properties.
      Impact:
        None.


Version 14.0.0.5  Jan 15, 2010
----------------------------------------
  1. Problem:
       When upgrading to the EEE enabled driver. Going from version 14.0.0.4 to version 14.0.04A.
       We could see the EEE property, however both the disable and enable values were missing.
       After a system reboot, we could see them.
     Cause:
       OS can't stick on the default value of EEE property right after driver upgrade.
     Change:
       Add a workaround to force OS to stick with EEE default value after driver upgrade.

  2. Problem:
       CQ45268 - 5718: System will link at 1G when put system in S3/S4/S5 mode.
     Cause:
       The fix for CQ44614 has assigned real/correct GPHY ID for 5718 copper interface. However it has a falw
       which makes part of driver code (ex. LM_ForceAutoNegBcm540xPhy()) is not executed and it causes problem.
     Change:
       The driver code is executed with new 5718 GPHY ID for copper interface.
     Impact:
       None.

  3. Problem:
       CQ45152 - sawtooth: PLLpowerdown and CLKREQ.
     Cause:
       This is a A0 hardware issue that is Sawtooth does not allow PLLPowerdown in L1 to be enabled
       if CLKREQ is also enabled.
     Change:
       Workaround by if CLKREQ is not enabled, driver needs to enable device L1 PLLPowerdown.

  4.  Problem:
        Driver failed on DTM 1c_kernelcalls test
      Cause:
        Driver has incorrectly made a call to DbgBreakPoint() with free version driver.
      Change:
        Remove DbgBreakPoint() from free version driver.

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        CQ45261 - Add 4 part ID support for specific OEM.
      Change:
        Added IDs
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Request:
        CQ45271 - Disable gigabit capability for specific OEM platform.
      Change:
        Make inf changes as requested.
      Impact:
        None.

  3.  Request
        CQ45290 - Update Product_Version String to 15.0.0 for Release 14.0.
      Change:
        Change the product version as required.
      Impact:
        None.

  4.  Request
        57765/57785 "DMA Read/Write Control Register" access (offset 0x6C)
      Change:
        Make change for driver to program bit 21:19 for "DMA Write WaterMark" only.
        For other bits, let bootcode to control it.
      Impact:
        None.

  5.  Request:
        Change the Copyright information to include 2010 for all SW modules
      Change:

  =============
  1.  Request:
        Add an advanced property entry to enable EEE for 5717/5718/57765/57785 family devices,
        and have the setting default to disabled.
      Impact:
        None.


Version 14.0.0.4  Jan 08, 2010
----------------------------------------
  1. Problem:
       CQ45009 - Bacscli: BSOD occurs wihle performing PHY loopback on 5704 with latest driver.
     Cause:
       During continuous PHY loopback test, Bacscli will pass T3_OID_SET_LINE_SETTINGS to make driver setup
       GPHY for loopback mode or normal mode repeatedly. In some particular condition, Bacscli may pass the
       OID to driver for starting PHY loopback test while driver is still servicing the Link Change interrupt
       for the normal mode requested by Bacscli last time. This makes driver to free up a spinlock which is not
       acquired yet, and it makes system BSOD.
     Change:
       Adding a delay in driver before servicing T3_OID_SET_LINE_SETTINGS to let driver finish the DPC for
       servicing the link change interupt.
     Impact:
        None.

  2. Problem:
       CQ44614 - 5718 Fiber: Flow Control does not work when set to "Auto" in W2K8sp2.
     Cause:
       Driver is not using correct PHY address for accessing Serdes GPHY. It makes device unable to get
       correct Flow Control setting of link partner while doing Auto-Negotiation.
     Change:
       Use the correct PHY address while driver is accessing Serdes GPHY.
     Impact:
       None.

  3. Problem:
       CQ45051 - 5718/57765: Running 1 session cc32 is sluggish.
     Change:
       Adjust default interrupt coalescing setting to improve the performance.
     Impact:
       None.

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        EEE LPI is enable only if EEE PHY negotiation success.
      Impact:
        The change is for 57765/57785 and 5717/5718 family devices only.

  2.  Request:
        Add GPHY Green Mode support for 5717/5718/57765/57785 family devices.
      Change:
        Whenever link is at 1G and cable length is less than 10m, driver
        will enable device GPHY Green Mode for saving power.


Version 14.0.0.3  Dec 18, 2009
----------------------------------------
  1. Problem:
       CQ43457 - specific OEM Management Port w/ NX1 controllers hangs and panics system during SW upgrade
     Cause:
       The driver can't be suspended after firmware upgrade because some rx packets never return back to
       the driver and causes specific OEM's heart beat timer timeout.
     Change:
       Return failure status for this case.
     Impact:
        Cause FW upgrade program return non-zero exit code.

  2. Problem:
       CQ44866 - 5718: The link speed is 100M when put system to S5 mode with NVRAM WOL enabled.
     Cause:
       The link speed should be 10M while system is in S5 with WOL speed set to LSA. However, the
       additional power-switching operation added for CQ44688 fix in the device reset routine has
       caused an unexpected reset after Vmain has been removed when system is in S5.
     Change:
       Remove the unnecessary power-switching in the driver reset rountine.
     Impact:
       It's for NIC design type only not for LOM.

  3. Problem:
       CQ44894 - Switch Flow control doesn't work correctly while system boots into OS
     Cause:
       Driver doesn't do GPHY Auto-Negotiation while it's loaded with cable connected. This makes switch
       (with pause frame setting = AUTO) unable to determine device's pause frame ability when link is up.
     Change:
       Make driver to do GPHY Auto-Negotiation while it's loaded with cable connected.
     Impact:
       None.

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        CQ44826 - Add 4 part ID support for specific OEM.
      Change:
        Added IDs
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Request:
        Enhanced change for EEE function to prevent link drop during heavy traffic.
      Impact:
        The change is for 57765/57785 and 5717/5718 family devices only.


Version 14.0.0.2  Dec 05, 2009
------------------------------
  1. Problem:
       CQ44688 - Device doesn't switch from Vaux to Vmain while either port is enabled from both ports are diabled.
     Cause:
       Driver doesn't switch device power source from Vaux to Vmain while device is disabled and then enabled.
     Change:
       Make sure device is on Vmain whenever driver is loaded.
     Impact:
       It's for NIC design type only not for LOM.

  2. Problem:
       CQ44702 - The link speed is 100M after system entering S1/S3/S4 mode while Power Management is disabled.
     Cause:
       The bootcode set the link speed at 100M when Vmain goes away is due to the wol enable bit is set in
       the NVRAM. The bootcode will honor the wol enable bit in nvram is due to no wol_signature in shared
       memory offset 0xd30.
     Change:
       Make driver to setup wol signature correctly when wol function is enabled.
     Impact:
       None

  3. Problem:
       CQ42316 - During Factory X64 download, Active directory scripts are not downloading.
     Cause:
       The Netlongon service starts before network is ready. The reason why netowrk is not ready is due to
       an additional GPHY reset added during code merge for 5785, this extra GPHY reset makes device take
       longer time to link up while driver is loaded.
     Change:
       Make the GPHY reset for 5785 only, not for other devices.
     Impact:
       None

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        Adding support for 57765/57785 ASIC GPHY ID.
      Change:
        GPHY MII reg 0x2 = 0x0362, GPHY MII reg 0x3 = 0x5e40.
      Impact:
        None.
  2.  Support EEE PHY.


Version 14.0.0.1  Nov 11, 2009
------------------------------
  1. Problem:
       CQ44524 - iSCSI boot might fail or boot very slow in Win2K3 when latest iSCSI ROM is used.
     Cause:
       Newer iSCSI ROM runs in polling mode.  It masks out PCI interrupt
       by setting bit 10 in PCI Command register. In Win2k8 or newer, OS
       clears this bit when it runs in non MSI-X mode. However, Win2K3
       doesn't do this.  This bit is new in PCI v2.3.
     Change:
       Clear PCI masking bit if it runs in legacy PCI mode.
     Impact:
       None

  2. Problem:
       CQ44649 - 57765: Ping time out while jumbo frame enable
     Cause:
       The code for setting NIC Ring Address in Jumbo Receive RCB (Ring Control Block)
       is missing during code merging from branch.
     Change:
       Add the missing code back to set up Jumbo Receive RCB correctly.
     Impact:
       None

  3. Problem:
       CQ44586 - 5718: System halt (BSOD) while installing driver on specific OEM system.
     Cause:
       Driver (for 64-bit OS) will generate 2 DWORD Memory Write while accessing APE Host Registers.
       However, device does not support Memory Write with 2 DWORD. So device will generate
       ERROR_NONFATAL message to rootcomplex and set bit_15 (Completer Abort Status) of
       Uncorrectable Error Status Register (0x104).
     Change:
       Prevent driver from generating 2 DWORD Memory Write while working with 64-bit OS.
     Impact:
       None

  4. Problem:
       CQ44443 - 5718: When system enters S3, device gets link at 100Mbps while doing WOL negative test.
     Cause:
       Driver for dual ports NIC design needs to make handshake before doing power-switching, only one driver
       instance needs to do the power switching. The current driver code will make twice power switching for NIC,
       this causes an unexpected reset after Vmain is removed. Then bootcode will be reloaded and configure
       link speed to 100Mbps instead of powering the device with no link (when WOL is not needed).
     Change:
       Make driver to handle power-switching for device with NIC design properly (by using APE Ctrl register
       0x08 bits[19:2] for dual-port message exchange).
     Impact:
       None.

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        CQ44669 - Add 4 part ID support for specific OEM.
      Change:
        Added IDs
      Impact:
        None.


Version 14.0.0.0  Nov 19, 2009
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ44266 - 5761 (with DASH enabled) has low chariot thruput result under WinXP.
      Cause:
        The code for NQS (Network Quarantine Service) is incorrectly executed while NQS

----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ42095 - Windows XP 64 failed NDIS Test 6.0 with 2c_recvmulticast test.
      Cause:
        Device is using hash algorithm (with 128 bits - four 32-bit hash registers) for multicast filter,
        when there are lots of multicast addresses added to device, it becomes that several multicast addresses
        are mapping to the same bit in hash table. The makes device still able to receive multicast packets with
        the destination address is not in the multicast list during 2c_recemulticast negative test.
      Change:
        Make driver to examine multicast packet's destination address, if it's not in driver's mulicast list,
        driver will filter out the packet.
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ42211 - B57Driver is unable to filter packets with NQS (Network Quarantine Service).

Version 12.2.0.0  April 20, 2009
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ40017 - DASH: does not show correct Driver version in Software Inventory.
      Cause:
        There is a problem with the new 4-part NDIS driver versioning scheme (e.g. 12.0.0.5).
        The existing APE shared memory interface definition only supports 3-part driver version numbers (e.g. 12.0.0).
      Change:
        A new field has been created for an 8-bit driver build number (e.g. 12.0.0.n) to be supported.
      Impact:
        None

  2.  Problem:
        CQ40241 - APE shared memory initialized/updated incorrectly on Vista-x64 and XP-64.
      Cause:
        Driver uses function RtlZeroMemory() to initialize APE shared memory while it
        is loaded. However, the function will make x64 OS to generate invalid "Memory Write"
        to device when the virtual address (mapped to device APE shared memory) is used as
        input address. Similiar issue happens when driver is trying to copy message data
        (eg. date/time) from application/BMAPI to APE shared memory using NdisMoveMemory().
      Change:
        Use other addressing method to make OS generate "Memory Write" with correct data
        while driver is trying to initialize/update device's APE shared memory.
      Impact:
        None

  3.  Problem:
        CQ39984 - WinFWUPG (57760 with ATMLH742) after upgrade asf, run "crc" will get checksum failed.
      Cause:
        Driver does not handle eeprom page write correctly. When page write crosses the page boundary
        the data word address will roll over and the previous data will overwritten.
      Change:
        Make driver to handle eeprom page write properly so that eeprom is programmed correctly.
      Impact:
        None

  4.  Problem:
        CQ39024 - Link flap issue on Cisco switch with 5704S
      Cause:
        Driver and boot code both dropped link and triggered an unrecoverable error in the switch.
      Change:
        Reset the RxCpu only during shutdown and disable instead of GRC reset.
        This applies only to 5704S chip.
      Impact:
        None

      Cause:
        Driver has incorrect configuration values for EEPROM which makes driver treat EEPROM as a flash device.
        This make driver can't write correct data into EEPROM and cause checksum error.
      Change:
        Correct code error to make driver use correct configuration when EEPROM is used.
      Impact:
        None

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        Do not write OTP bits if the bits have been set already.
      Change:
        Read data from OTP first and then compare the "orignal data" and "data to write",
        if the bits in "data to write" have set already, driver will skip the OTP write.

      Cause:
        Some device may generate "Link Status Change" interrupt immediately after powering down GPHY.
        This causes driver to run LM_SetupPhy() in UM_DPC() for servicing GPHY interrupt, while the
        application may send another T3_OID_PHY_ON to driver for powering on GPHY. This causes two
        driver threads to access GPHY at the same time, and it may cause GPHY content programmed
        with incorrect value.
      Change:
        Disable interrupt before powering down GPHY.
      Impact:
        None

----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ37048 - There are a lot of error events in the system event log when loading the driver.
      Cause:
        Driver fails to obtain APE mutex w/ non-5761 devices and then writes an entry to system error log.
        However, the APE mutex is only available for 5761 and the function should apply to 5761 devices only.
      Change:
        Only call the function to obtain APE mutex for 5761 devices.
      Impact:
        None.

  Enhancements:

        None


Version 10.87.0.0  August 25, 2008
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ36482 - 5761E looses net work connectivity after resuming from S3:DTM test
      Cause:
        CQ31830 workaround has a bug that it doesn't restore CPMU LinkSpeed1000 register properly when system
        resuming from sleep. And this workaround was incorrectly applied to 5761/5671E B0 and it causes CQ36482.
      Change:
        CQ31830 workaround should be applied for 5761/5761E Ax only because 5761E B0 have already fixed CQ31830.
        Driver has removed CQ31830 workaround for 5761/5761E B0.
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ36025 - NIC b5761m shows only 10Mbps speed when system boots from iSCSI boot with BootCode v3.57.
      Cause:
        Durinng iscsi boot, driver will do an additional chip resest in driver initialization.
        But driver does not wait for bootcode completing initialization and it continues to get eeprom info
        from shared memory. Then driver gets zero value from shared memory and this make driver assign wrong
        PhyId for 5761 GPHY and program 5761 GPHY incorrectly.
      Change:
        Make driver to wait until bootcode finishing initialization while doing additional chip reset.
      Impact:
        None.

  3.  Problem:
        CQ36558 - OEM requesting non-Fiber name for the 5714S (already have 4 part match)
      Change:
        Updated the infs.

        None.

  4.  Problem:
        CQ36482 - 5761E looses net work connectivity after resuming from S3:DTM test
      Cause:
        CQ31830 workaround has a bug that it doesn't restore CPMU LinkSpeed1000 register properly when system
        resuming from sleep. And this workaround was incorrectly applied to 5761/5671E B0 and it causes CQ36482.
      Change:
        CQ31830 workaround should be applied for 5761/5761E Ax only because 5761E B0 have already fixed CQ31830.
        Driver has removed CQ31830 workaround for 5761/5761E B0.
      Impact:
        None.


  5.  Problem:
        Mouse temporarily freezes when the NVRAM content is updated
        Note: This is also described in CQ35676
      Cause:
        NVRAM routines are not as efficient as they could be. This is becoming
        a problem for devices which store more information in NVRAM.
      Change:
        Port Soledad NVRAM redundant write inhibitor from the NDIS6 driver.
      Impact:
        None.

        Changed the driver to schedule its DPCs with a WDM call which
        specifies the DPC should run at high priority. The OEM confirmed
        the problem to be fixed with this change. This change only applies
        to this OEM specific 4-part IDs.
      Impact:
        This is a high risk change, to be tested extensively.

  4.  Request:

Version 10.85.0.0  June 19, 2008
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ35947 - B5764/B5761/B5784-When setting  WOL speed to 10mb system will be come unresponsive and lose link.
      Cause:
        The CQ35234 workaround is incorrectly executed when driver is loaded with WOL speed setting as 10mb.
        There is no problem when WOL speed is set to Lowest, Auto or 100mb.
      Change:
        Correct driver's abnormal behavior and make driver to apply the CQ35234 workaround precisely.
      Impact:
        None.


Version 10.84.0.0  June 10, 2008
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ34764 - DASH - B5761-B0 failure to wake from an interesting packet and Magic
        packet when DASH enabled.
      Cause:
        DASH behaviors is different with ASF for WOL. So driver need to handle an interesting
        packet and magic packet like no ASF. Also there was a bug when restoring DASH setting
        after reset which caused WOL was not enable.
      Change:
        handling interesting packet and magic packet as no ASF for DASH. The boot code v3.53
        or later are required for this fix.
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ35239 - 5784m stops passing traffic when running copy compare at 10 Mb half duplex and ASPM L1 w/ clkreq.
      Cause:
        The clock glitch that occurring with L0->L1->L0 transitions causes device RDMA doesn't work normally.
      Change:
        Make driver to disable device's clkreq when linked at 10H or 100H as a workaround.
      Impact:
        None.

  3.  Problem:
        CQ35234 - 5784M/5764M will not assert Wake signal one the first Wake magic packet received.
      Cause:
        When device is connected to particular switch with specific PHY at 1G bps, with wol speed
        set to lowest speed, driver will program GPHY to advertise 10M bps support and restart
        auto-negotiation while system is going from S0 to S3/S4/S5. In the meantime, 100tx or 1000t
        idle sent from the link partner can confuse the local 10M bps polarity state machine, which
        in turn can corrupt the first 10Mbps packet received.
      Change:
        Make driver workaround to reset link porlarity state machine and restart auto negotiation.
      Impact:
        None.

  4.  Problem:
        CQ35297 - Soledad GPHY scripts.
      Cause:
        GPHY WAR applied to 5784 need to be applied to the 5761 and 5761E.
      Change:
        Implemented the WAR.
      Impact:
        None.


Version 10.83.0.0  May 15, 2008
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ34962 - 5784/5764/5761 system compatibility issue on particular OEM system.
      Cause:
        When BIOS sets root-complex's and device's Max Payload Size (MPS) to 256 bytes,
        device's MPS will be incorrectly set to 128 by driver, then device will report
        ERROR_FATAL and stop DMA when it makes Memory Read and receives completion
        packets larger than 128 bytes.
      Change:
        Make driver to keep device MPS setting during initialization.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ34962.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ34743 - MTU size needs to be 4 bytes larger with Management FW enabled
      Cause:
        The MtuSize register needs to be programed with a value larger by 4 bytes.
        We need this change to allow the firmware to process max size VLAN packets
        while the driver is running.
      Change:
        Increased the MtuSize register by 4 bytes.
      Impact:
        No impact.

  3.  Problem:
        DASH processor stalls when the driver applies a GRC reset
        while the DASH processor is also accessing the GRC reset register
      Cause:
        A LSI bug is causing this behavior. This driver implements the LSI recommended workaround.
      Change:
        The workaround requires the driver to acquire a mutex register before issuing the GRC
        reset. The driver also waits 10us before releasing the mutex after the GRC reset
      Impact:
        DASH firmware 0.96 or later is required for this fix to work.

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        CQ34677 - Add 4 part ID support for specific OEM
      Change:
        Added IDs

        CQ34762 - The system will casue blue screen when changed the
        bootcode setting on b5761e-B0.
      Cause:
        BSOD if accessing Soledad's PCI FunctionEventMask register.
      Change:
        Not touch the register if it is Soledad
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Problem:
        Version information in some infs does not match the other infs.
        Doing automated version testing requires conformity.
      Cause:
        Not needed before automation of version verification.
      Change:
        Change the version information in DriverVer to be standard to include
        all four parts of our version.  Change the version information in
        the comment InfVersion to be of the format nn.nn.nn.nnX where the 'X'
        alphabetic suffix is only present for inf only releases.
      Impact:
        None.

  3.  Problem:
        Ensure private OID buffer is not touched until signature
        is validated.
      Cause:
        Could cause DTM failure if buffer is modified
        when signature is invalid.
      Change:
        Move setting status until after signature is validated.
      Impact:
        None

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        Enable constant 500Khz MDIO interface speed regardless core clock frequency.
      Change:
        Change driver to set the enable bit in MII Mode register.

        The change applies to devices 5764M/5784M/5723/5761/5761E.


Version 10.80.0.0  April 11, 2008
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        DASH traffic stops once the device transitions to S3
      Cause:
        The MacCtrl register is not programmed correctly when
        the driver transitions to S3/D3.
      Change:
        Program the MacCtrl correctly.
      Impact:
        None.


Version 10.79.0.0  April 10, 2008
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ34086 - B5761-A2 fails to wake from an interesting packet
      Cause:
        The latest 5761 NIC has a rework which swaps GPIO0 and GPIO2.
      Change:

Version 10.76.0.0  February 26, 2008
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ33858 - Device loses connection while doing load/unload test.
      Cause:
        When driver is unloaded, driver does a GRC Reset. When the link doesn't come back
        immediately, CPMU will put MAC core clock into slower speed. This makes boot code
        to be reloaed and executed slower. This also makes driver exceed waiting loop.
        Finally, GPHY register corrupted because of driver and boot-code racing condition.
      Change:
        Change CPMU Clock Policy Registers to increase the Core Clock Speed before issue
        a GRC reset and restore these registers after boot code has completed initialization.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ33858.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ33671 - Remove IDs checking for workaround to cq32720

Version 10.63  October 16, 2007
----------------------------------------
  1. Enhancement request

      Fix DTM failures with 5704

      Cause:
      A system DTM test prevents the driver from sending keep alive
      updates from being to the IPMI firmware. The lack of updates
      in turn causes the firmware to assume a driver failure,
      and eventually triggers an IPMI generated chip reset.
      The unexpected reset causes the driver to fail.

      Change:
      In the previous version, the updates occured in the driver
      DPC. Since this DPC was inhibited during the DTM test, The IPMI
      keep alive updates are moved to the driver ISR in this version.
      This ISR has been observed to run uninterrupted during the DTM test.

      Impact:
      Version 2.48 or later of the IPMI firmware is required

  2. Enhancement request
      CQs: 31633 - Add 4 part ID for specific OEM & Enable Estar feature.
      Change:
      Added new ID / Estar functionality

  3. Problem:

     Change:
      Added the requested IDs
     Impact:
      None.

  4. Problem:
       CQ31515 - 5722 PHY trim registers not programmed correctly.
      Cause:
       In the previous version, the driver programmed the 5722 PHY trim
       registers were programmed to match the settings
       needed to allow the 5755 device to pass IEEE tests.
       The driver was also programming the same settings for the 5722, which
       is incorrect.
     Change:
       Changed the driver to program 5722 PHY trim registers correctly.
     Impact:
       None.

  5. Problem:
       CQ32720,32118 Link up indication when actual link is down.
     Cause:
       The GPHY link status register does not always reflect the correct
       link status on some 5715S based designs. As a result, the driver reports
       the link status incorrectly to the OS. Please refer to CQ32720 for more
       information.
      Change:
       Changed the driver to read link status from the MAC LED register which
       is more reliable for this device. This fix is implemented for specific
       4 part IDs only.
       Please refer to CQ32720 for more information.
     Impact:
       None.

     Impact:
       None.

  5. Problem:
       CQ32720,32118 Link up indication when actual link is down.
     Cause:
       The GPHY link status register does not always reflect the correct
       link status on some 5715S based designs. As a result, the driver reports
       the link status incorrectly to the OS. Please refer to CQ32720 for more

Version 10.60  August 30, 2007
----------------------------------------
   1. Problem
        CQ28879 - The issue manifests itself as a non-maskable interrupt (NMI)
        blue screen during system reboot.
      Cause:
        In vista, TCP could make call into the miniport
        after driver's shutdown routine had been called (as a result of shutting
        down the system) in certain edge cases. This happens if a TCP internal
        timer expired after (or at about the same time) the driver's shutdown
        got called.
      Change:
        Changed the driver's OID handler to detect if it's safe to touch the
        hardware by taking into the shutdown state into account.

   2. Bug Fix
        CQ29255 5704 fails 2c_offloadlargesend test
      Cause:
        This problem occurs whenever 32-bit TCP sequence number wraps around
        during segmentation.   The TCP Seq# for this particular failure is
        0xfffffffa.  This problem has been fixed in other offload firmware
        modules in year of 2002 but was NEVER backported to TCP segmentation
        ONLY firmware for BCM5701/02/03/04 used in Windows driver.  In other
        words, LSO firmware for BCM5705 DOES NOT have this problem.  This
        explains why hardware-based LSO doesnt have this problem since it
        was designed based on BCM5705-based firmware.

      Change:
        New LSO firmware.

        There is an interoperability issue between the Broadcom
        LAN controllers and the Intel ICH7/8 that may cause the
        Rx-performance at 100 Mbps to be lower then expected when
        L1 ASPM is enabled along with system CPU C3E, or C4, or C4E
        or higher state.
      Change:
        Along with the device driver change here, that will drive
        the PCI-E link less aggressively into L1 ASPM during
        network stress, the user must enable the feature
        by setting a configurable option inside the LAN
        controllers NVRAM.
      Impact:
        There is no known impact from enabling this
        feature.  As a matter of fact, enabling this
        feature will increase the power savings in
        case the system has disabled 'L1 ASPM' due to
        the interoperability issue described above.

Version 10.18  November 14, 2006
----------------------------------------
   1. Problem:
        5906 exhibits poor performance.
      Cause:
        Coalescing all buffers for the 5906 is slow (see fix in 10.17).
      Change:
        Restore the origninal logic which coalesces only when the OS submits
        packets with segments less than 8 bytes. In addition, disable the
        header coalesce logic for the 5906, since it generates segments less
        than 8 bytes (see CQ14560).
      Impact:
        None.

Version 10.17  November 14, 2006
----------------------------------------
   1.  Enhancement Request:

      Change:
        Modify the phy init code to enable Auto-MDIX.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ26645 Enhancement Request.

   2. Problem:
        For the 5906, the driver still sends small Buffer Descriptors to the
        hardware. Due to a chip bug, small buffers cause the DMA engine to
        stall, so the driver is required to screen the packets received from
        the OS, and coalesce all packets which include small buffers.
        In addition, 5906 performance is poor when multiple buffers are sent
        to the hardware.
      Cause:
        Code added to resolve CQ14560 cause the driver to internaly
        generate buffers less than 8 bytes, and submit them to the hardware.
      Change:
        To workaround these problems, all packets transmitted by the OS
        are coalesced.

   3. Problem:
        CQ27383 WHQL - Fails Duplicate WolPattern test.
      Cause:
        The latest test kit requires the ndis driver to return

      Change:
        Modified the ndis driver to return NDIS_STATUS_INVALID_DATA on
        duplicate WOL patterns.

   4. Problem:
        CQ27389 - Fix for CQ14031 is not working.
      Cause:
        Fix for CQ26524 broke fix for CQ14031 by restarting autonegotiation
        when the link partner did not advertise flow control capability.
      Change:
        Modified fix for CQ26524 to not restart autonegotiation if the link
        partner does not advertise flow control.

   3.  Problem:
        CQ25292   5701  High Percent Processor Usage in Interrupt Time
        when in  AMD64  platform.
      Cause:
        Memory Coherency issue prevented driver from disabling Interrupts
        as part of its procedure to process DPC operations.
        This problem is only applicable to AMD64 platforms.
      Change:
        Apply Windows DDK recommended macro  KeMemoryBarrier() to
        Driver Register Writes and Register Reads done while in the
        Interrupt Service Routine; so that all memory operations are
        coherent and completed.  The normal Driver Register Writes and
        Reads (not in the Interrupt context) were already using the
        KeMemoryBarrier() macro in their definition.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ25292 issue.

   4.  Problem:
        CQ25020 Unable to modify nvram when 5714 or 5715 is using 45DB011B flash.

      Cause:
        The ndis driver did not recognize this memory type.
      Change:
        Corrected the ndis driver to handle this memory type properly.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ25292, CQ25382 issue.

   5.  Problem:
        CQ25155 and CQ23480. Under rare circumstances, 5721 devices can
        encounter a read DMA overrun.  This would result in subsequent
        read DMA operations not completing.  This in turn would lead
        to network applications failing or "timing out".
      Cause:
        This is due to a newly discovered corner case HW bug in the 5721.
        The same problem is also in 5751, 5753, 5789, 5752, and 5755
        devices.  5787, 5705, and devices introduced before the 5721 and
        5751 are not affected by this issue.  This HW issue can occur
        under a rare circumstance where a very large Rx BD read
        request is generated while the RDMA read FIFO is partially filled
        with Tx  data and the TxMbuf memory is full.  Most network
        applications would never generate this circumstance, and thus this
        problem is hard to reproduce, and won't occur with most network
        applications. This problem could theoretically occur at 1Gb speed
        but is more likely to occur at 10mb or 100mb operation, and is more
        likely to occur with applications that generate lots of smaller
        (e.g. 82B) packets. More information about this issue will be
        included in future 57xx chip errata documents for affected
        devices.
      Change:
        Modified the driver to limit how many BDs the HW will try to fetch
        at any given time.  With this workaround, the HW should never
        fetch more than 15 RX BDs in a read burst during runtime (not init
        time). This avoids the circumstance that could expose the HW
        erratum.
      Impact:
        The performance impact of this change is negligible.


   6.  Enhancement Request:
        CQ25620 Add new PCI Four Part Device IDs for OEM customer.

      Cause:
        New OEM project IDs requested.
      Change:
        Added new PCI ID support in NDIS INF files.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ24584 Enhancement Request.

   7.  Problem:
        CQ24316 When a system is continually reboooted, and a 5721 device
        is physically connected to a Cisco Catalyst 6500 switch, and the
        link speed and duplex is forced to 100mb FDX, the driver may
        very intermittently believe that link is down, even when it is up.
        This results in no network connectivity.  This problem is hard to
                reproduce (it could take many hours, or even days, of reboots).
      Cause:
        Intermittently when connected to this Cisco switch, the link will
        "bounce" (it will go down->up->down->up in rapid succession)
        instead of just going "up".  If the timing of the link bounce meets
        a very narrow window of vulnerability (it must go down->up->down->up
        all in the span of a few milliseconds), the driver may "miss" the
        interrupt for the final link up indication. This results in the
        driver thinking that link is down instead of up, and this in turn
        results in no network connectivity since the OS protocols think that
        link is down.
      Change:
        Modified the code in the driver that checks the link state to close
        the narrow window of vulnerability.  If the driver detects a link
        "bounce", it will re-call a certain initialization routine to ensure
        that the driver doesn't miss the final link up indication after a link
        bounce.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ24316 issue.  There should be no negative side-effect of this
                change.

   8.  Enhancement Request:
        CQ24691  Add Two PCI 4 Part Device ID for OEM Projects.
      Cause:
        Two new OEM Device support requested.
      Change:
        Added two new 4 part PCI ID support in NDIS INF files.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ24691 Enhancement Request.

   9.  Enhancement Request:
        Improve power savings for CQ23438.
      Change:
        Modified driver code to enable power down of the GPHY DLL and modify
        read dma thresholds when link is not present.
      Impact:
        Power consumption will be lower than versiion 9.50 when link
        is down.

Version 9.50  March 21, 2006
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ23438 System with 5752M fails to get DHCP address on boot
        if LAN cable was disconnected during OS boot and later
        connected after user log on to Windows.
      Cause:
        A non recoverable Read DMA error occurs in this test scenario,
        due to NIC's internal core clock being automatically slowed down
        by logic in the device when the GPHY DLL is  automatically powered
        down when CAT 5 cable is disconnected.
        The GPHY DLL automatically gets powered down and NIC's internal
        core clock gets slowed down when the CAT 5 cable disconnected,
        this is an intended design power saving feature.
        Unfortunately, the slowed down of the core-clock causes Read DMA
        error, which resulted in the system failed to acquire the IP address
        via DHCP.
      Change:
        Modified driver code to Not  Enable the GPHY DLL Auto-Power-Down
        feature of hardware for 5752M Devices.

        CQ23551 Disable GPHY DLL power-down on 5752M, 5754M,
        5755M, and 5787M Devices.
      Cause:
        Same problem as CQ23438 would occur for the listed devices.
        A non recoverable Read DMA error occurs in this test scenario,
        due to NIC's internal core clock being automatically slowed down
        by logic in the device when the GPHY DLL is  automatically powered
        down when CAT 5 cable is disconnected.
        The GPHY DLL automatically gets powered down and NIC's internal
        core clock gets slowed down when the CAT 5 cable disconnected,
        this is an intended design power saving feature.
        Unfortunately, the slowed down of the core-clock causes Read DMA
        error, which resulted in the system failed to acquire the IP address
        via DHCP.
      Change:
        Modified driver code to Not Enable the GPHY DLL Auto-Power-Down
        feature of hardware for all  5752M, 5754M, 5755M, 5787M Devices.
      Impact:
        Higher power consumption on these devices when the device is
        enabled, but the network link is down.
        Resolve CQ23551 issue.

  3.  Problem:

  7.  Problem:
        CQ23647 5714S - Cable Disconnect/Connect Test fails
        and is not able to resume network activity.
      Cause:
        Earlier fix for "CQ22620 Link LED stays on 5714S/5715S devices"
        did an unconditional PHY Reset to bring the PHY out of Low
        Power Mode. However this would cause a 5714S that was not
        in Low Power Mode to lose connectivity and not get Link connection.
      Change:
        Added driver code to Read PHY Power Mode and only assert
        PHY Reset if the PHY is in actual Low Power Mode. So that
        normal cable connect and disconnect events do not trigger
        Serdes PHY Reset operation.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ23647 issue.

  8.  Problem:
        CQ23703 5701 does not link at correct speed after changing adapter
        properties.

        Resolve CQ23703 issue.

  9.  Problem:
        CQ23798 Wake from ping doesn't work after running 2m_WOLPattern script.
      Cause:
        A bug in the device driver did not remove WOL test patterns from test
        script which was causing the regular WOL patterns from the OS to be
        rejected.
      Change:
        Corrected driver to remove WOL properly.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ23798.

      Cause:
        New 4 ID device match support requests by OEM.
      Change:
        Added new 4 ID device matches for OEM project.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ14196/14197 Enhancement Request.

  2.  Problem:
        The driver could enable the interesting packet WoL bit
        when the driver was disabled (halted) and ASF/IPMI was also
        disabled. On 5705 and later devices, when this bit is enabled,
        a portion of internal memory in the device (misc_bd region)
        is not accessible to the host driver or FW.  This in turn
        could lead to a faulty driver/FW handshake when the driver was
        re-enabled, and under very rare circumstances the faulty
        handshake could lead to GPHY register corruption, which in
        turn could lead to the GPHY being set for the wrong
        speed/duplex, or the GPHY could be configured to be in a
        non-functioning state.
      Cause:
        The driver would set the interesting packet wake-up bit when
        the driver was halted (even though there is no need to do
        this), when ASF/IPMI PT was disabled.
      Change:
        Updated Windows Driver code to only enable the interesting
        packet WoL bit when the system is going into S1/S3/S4, and not
        when the driver is disabled.
      Impact:
        There should be no side-effects from this change.

  3.  Problem:
        CQ 14030 When IPMI PT is enabled, an extra link down/up message
        pair could be logged in the Event log when a driver loads.  On
        some systems (depending on timing on the platform in question),
        the extra link up/down events during driver load could result
        in an auto login to a domain to fail when teaming was enabled.
      Cause:
        If IPMI PT is enabled, the device will by default auto-neg to
        10/100 only in an OS absent (driver not loaded) environment.
        This is per design to save power (Because IPMI does not need
        a 1Gb link).  When the driver loads, it needs to modify the GPHY
        config to advertise 10/100/1000 and restart auto-neg.  Although
        the driver was properly restarting auto-neg, it was not
        clearing the "pDevice->RestartAutoneg" in the init code before
        indicating a link up.  Because of this, the driver was
        improperly restarting auto-neg again after a 1Gb link had been
        established with a 10/100/1000 switch  port.  This "double"
        restarting of auto-neg led to the link down/up messages in the
        event viewer, and could cause (depending on system timing) the
        netlogon failure.
      Change:
        Updated the driver code to clear the "pDevice->RestartAutoneg"
        flag in the LM_ForceAutoNegBcm540xPhy() subroutine when
        auto-neg is restarted the 1st time.
      Impact:
        There should be no side-effects from this change.

  4.  Problem:
        CQ 14031 NetLogon fails upon reboot when using a Team of 2 NICs
        when flow control is set to any value other "disabled" in the
        Windows network driver properties.  This problem is similar,
        but not identical to CQ 14030.  As with CQ 14030, when this
        problem occurs (when flow control is set to a value other than
        "disabled"), a link down/up message pair would be logged in the
        Event log when a driver loads because the driver is restarting
        auto-neg (to modify the advertised flow control parameters)
        after it had previously indicated link up to the OS.  This
        issue will only occur if auto-negotiation is enabled.
      Cause:
        If flow control is not disabled, and if auto-neg is enabled,
        the driver will need to modify the registers in the GPHY to
        advertise the proper flow control support, and then restart
        auto-neg.  However, the driver was doing this at the very end
        of the initialization code, after it had already indicated a
        link-up to the OS.  Thus, from the OS perspective, the link
        was up, and then it was dropped, and then it would go back up
        later.  This bouncing of the link could result in a netlogon
        failure if teaming was enabled because the OS was not designed
        to be tolerant of a link down/up indication during a domain
        login, and depending on the timing (which was exacerbated by
        teaming), failures with the login could occur.  Lastly, this
        problem was introduced by the fix for CQ 9033 and 9124.
      Change:
        Updated the driver code to restart auto-neg earlier in the
        initialization process if flow control is not disabled.  By
        doing this, the driver will not give the OS a link up
        indication until after auto-neg has completed with the new
        GPHY Flow control advertisement settings.  By doing this,
        the "bouncing" of link up/down/up indications to the OS is
        avoided.
      Impact
        The fix for CQ 9033/9124 was re-done.  This new fix should
        not re-introduce CQ 9033/9124, but flow control should
        definitely be re-tested with this new driver due to this change.

  5.  Problem:
        Intermittent BSOD when loading/unloading driver on 5755_A0.
      Cause:
        After accessing the nvram interface, other register reads
        may be corrupted causing the device driver to behave incorrectly.
        This is an errata on the 5755A0 device.
        Earlier workaround implemented in v8.44 contained a corner case
        where the driver may clobber the Memory Arbitor register.
      Change:
        Corrected workaround implemented in v8.44 to wait for the bootcode
        to enable the Memory Arbitor.
        Corrected a corner case where the driver was sending a pause command
        to the firmware while the cpu was halted.
      Impact:
        Resolve BSOD issue on 5755_A0


Version 8.45  September 27, 2005
----------------------------------------
  1.  Enhancement Request:

      Cause:
        New 4 ID device match support request by OEM.
      Change:
        Added new 4 ID device match for OEM project.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ14115 Enhancement Request.

  3.  Problem:
        CQ14105 5787 Device Shows link when Wake up Capabilities
        are set to NONE and SUT is sent into sleep states S1, S3,
        and S4, and ASF is disabled.
      Cause:
        The function in the driver that put the device in a low power
        state and turn off the GPHY when WoL and ASF were disabled, was
        skipping the 5787 device for this operation.
      Change:
        Updated Windows Driver code to treat the 5787 device similar
        to other devices (such as the 5751) and correct this problem.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ14105 issue.

 4.  Problem:
        CQ13907 BMC isn´t reachable via LAN after an invoked
        Blue Screen. System monitored would lose LAN connection
        when the OS was forced into a Blue Screen condition.
      Cause:
        Driver v8.40 Enhancement # 6 addition enabled a feature
        in the NDIS driver that was not necessary.  The feature
        involved the driver sending IPMI PT FW a "heartbeat" message,
        and the FW would reset the chip if it did not get the
        heartbeat because its watchdog timer would expire.  This
        feature was faulty in the NDIS driver because if the OS
        was extremely stressed, the driver would not be able to
        update the heartbeat in a timely manner, and this could result
        in a false watchdog timeout assertion.  The falsely detected
        timeout would then lead to a reset, which would then cause
        multiple downstream problems including this issue.
      Change:
        Removed the NDIS Driver enabling of ASF IPMI Watch Dog
        Timer.  This feature was not needed in this driver. If a
        BSOD were to occur, the driver's "Shutdown" routine would
        be called, and the driver would reset the HW.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ13907 issue.

 5.  Problem:
        CQ14121 5715-A2: Its Primary Port Becomes Non-Responsive,
        when Four Interfaces Are Evaluated in Dell Precision 470 PAE
        based System
      Cause:
        Driver v8.40 Enhancement # 6 addition enabled a feature
        in the NDIS driver that was not necessary.  The feature
        involved the driver sending IPMI PT FW a "heartbeat" message,
        and the FW would reset the chip if it did not get the
        heartbeat because its watchdog timer would expire.  This
        feature was faulty in the NDIS driver because if the OS
        was extremely stressed, the driver would not be able to
        update the heartbeat in a timely manner, and this could result
        in a false watchdog timeout assertion.  The falsely detected
        timeout would then lead to a reset, which would then cause
        multiple downstream problems including this issue.
      Change:
        Removed the NDIS Driver enabling of ASF IPMI Watch Dog
        Timer.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ14121 issue.


Version 8.44  September 20, 2005
----------------------------------------

        CQ14024 Add 4 ID device match for new OEM project.
      Cause:
        New 4 ID device match support request by OEM.
      Change:
        Added new 4 ID device match for OEM project.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ14024 Enhancement Request.

  2.  Enhancement Request:
        CQ14025 Add 4 ID device match for new OEM project.
      Cause:
        New 4 ID device match support request by OEM.
      Change:
        Added new 4 ID device match for OEM project.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ14025 Enhancement Request.

  3.  Problem:
        CQ13920 5714 A2 and 5715 A2 Maintains Link despite Driver
        being disabled in Windows.
      Cause:
        Revision A0 and A1 of 5714 and 5715 devices had limitations
        that prevented the NDIS Driver from powering off the GPHY in
        one port while the other port was running and active.
        Turning off the PHY is only applicable when ASF is Disabled
        and no WOL is expected from 5714 and 5715 devices and the
        device is being Disabled in Windows Device Manager.
      Change:
        Added 5714 and 5715 and 5780 revision aware driver code to
        properly manage PHY power when the device is being disabled
        or when system is powering down.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ13920 issue.

  4.  Enhancement Request:
        CQ14035 Add 4 ID device match for new OEM project.
      Cause:
        New 4 ID device match support request by OEM.
      Change:
        Added new 4 ID device match for OEM project.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ14035 Enhancement Request.

  5.  Enhancement Request:
        CQ13818 Add 4 ID device match for new OEM projects.
      Cause:
        New 4 ID device match support request by OEM.
      Change:
        Added new 4 ID device match for OEM projects.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ13818 Enhancement Request.

  6.  Problem:
        CQ14056 Interesting packet wakeup does not work on 5755 and 5787.
      Cause:
        The interesting packet wakeup patterns on 5755 and 5787
        controllers are stored in a different memory location inside
        shared memory.
      Change:
        Changed the driver to store interesting packet wakeup patterns
        from offset 0x4000 to 0x8000 for 5755 and 5787.
      Impact:
        The interesting packet wakeup feature for 5755 and 5787 is working.

  7.  Problem:
        BSOD when loading/unloading the driver on 5755.
      Cause:
        After accessing the nvram interface, other register reads
        may be corrupted causing the device driver to behave incorrectly.
        This is an errata on the 5755A0 device.
      Change:
        A workaround for 5755A0 when accessing the nvram interface
        has been implemented to prevent the corruption of register reads.
      Impact:
        The workaround will cause the driver to require 2 additional
        seconds to load on 5755A0 devices.



Version 8.43  September 14, 2005
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ13948 LSO does not function on 5787/5755.
      Cause:
        A typo in the LSO code for 5787/5755 ported from the ndis6 driver.
      Change:
        Corrected typo.
      Impact:
        LSO on 5787 and 5755 is now functional.


Version 8.42  September 12, 2005
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ13941 5714s A2 (Fiber) Unable to establish Connectivity in
        Windows 32/64 bit.
      Cause:
        A Driver and Bootcode combined attempted fix for CQ13216
        did not work as expected. The change for CQ13216 was added
        to v8.40 driver and was also present in v8.41 driver.
      Change:
        Reverted NDIS Driver change for CQ13216 fix that involved
        setting of Bit 4 in Register 0x6808 and now clear both Bits 4 and 5.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ13941 issue.

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1. Request:
        Add 2 part PCI ID Support for new Broadcom Device: 5903M
      Change:
        Added new PCI ID support to the XP64, XP32, AMD64, and NDIS4
        installation INF files.
      Impact:
        None.



Version 8.41  September 07, 2005
----------------------------------------
  1.  Enhancement Request:
        CQ13816 Add 4 ID device match for new OEM project.
      Cause:
        New 4 ID device match support request by OEM.
      Change:
        Added new 4 ID device match for OEM project.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ13816 Enhancement Request.

  2.  Enhancement Request:
        CQ13817 and CQ13818 Add 4 ID device match for new OEM projects.
      Cause:
        New 4 ID device match support request by OEM.
      Change:
        Added new 4 ID device match for OEM projects.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ13817 and CQ12818 Enhancement Requests.

  3.  Problem:
        CQ10476 BCM5751 Shasta: Mismatched TX vs. RX Statistics counters
        during continuous file transfer operation. Fix in v8.40 did not resolve
        issue.
      Cause:
        The fix put in v8.40 relied on a general purpose timer in BCM57xx
        miniport driver that may get cancelled if network Link Up is not
        established within 3 seconds of start of initialization at boot up.
        As a result of this and getting Link Up at just over 3 seconds, the
        driver workaround of reading and refreshing the device Statistics
        periodically did not get executed at all. This resulted in v8.40 fix not
        resolving the issue of mismatched TX/RX counters after a long copy
        and compare session.
      Change:
        Modified driver to wait 6 seconds for the initial network Link Up and
        not cancel the general purpose timer used for this workaround until
        the 6 second time has expired.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ10476 issue.

  4.  Problem:
        CQ13764  Stress test in new Windows Vista Beta version
        causes a watchdog timeout for b57xp32.sys driver
        DPC (Deffered Procedure Call).   This problem is specific to
        unreleased Windows Vista Beta OS version and Beta WHQL
        HCT tests and therefore unrelated to current officially supported
        OS and WHQL Certification programs.
      Cause:
        The 57xx driver DPC code uses and invokes various NDIS
        procedure calls to get and send Transmit packets as well as
        notify the OS of arrived Receive packets. When system and NIC
        stress conditions are produced during running of LAN Device tests;
        these calls to NDIS service routines take longer and longer to
        complete. The Windows Vista watchdog routine then flags the
        b57xp32 device driver as taking too long to finish its DPC function.
      Change:
        Added a new time limit code with default of 10 milliseconds to the
        b57xp32 device driver's DPC function, so that it returns control back
        to the OS and avoids the watchdog timer problem.
        The newly added code for DPC time limit is applicable only to NDIS 5.1
        and later versions.  The default of 10 milliseconds time limit for
        b57xp32 DPC function can be adjusted by use of a documented
        Windows Registry parameter.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ13764 issue.

  5.  Problem:
        CQ13873 5714/15-A2 NIC involve in BSOD for an illegal DMA operation,
        when evaluating Jumbo Frame feature.
      Cause:
        A change for Netware driver in shared NDIS and NETWARE source file
        caused the NDIS driver to misallocate required memory for proper
        Jumbo frame operation.
        This problem was present in 57xx NDIS drivers: v8.33 thru 8.40 as
        well as v8.39.1 and its B and C INF updates.
      Change:
        Added a conditional compile switch in driver source file to let both NDIS
        and Netware coexist with different Jumbo frame initializations.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ13873 issue.

  6.  Problem:
        Add support for Large Send Offload on 5755 and 5787.
      Cause:
        New hardware requirement specific to 5755 and 5787.
      Change:
        Added conditional code for 5755 and 5787 Large Send Offload
        transactions to include the Tcp/Ip Header length in the send
        buffer descriptors.
        Added a conditional compile switch in driver source file to let both NDIS
        and Netware coexist with different Jumbo frame initializations.
      Impact:
        Resolve LSO support issue on 5755 and 5787.





Version 8.40  August 25, 2005
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ10476 BCM5751 Shasta: Mismatched TX vs. RX Statistics count
        during continuous file transfer operation.
      Cause:
        Shasta Devices with PCI ID of 0x1677 have a 28 bit wide statistics
        Register limitation (as compared to 32 bits in other devices) .
        This will lead to roll over of TX Packets sent counter after 12 hours
        of file copy and compare to a network drive that is using the
        BCM5751 device with link speed of 1 gig.
        This roll over of TX packets sent versus RX packets received causes
        Windows show of Network Device statistics to be incorrect and the
        RX number will be much bigger. This is only a TX statistic issue and
        proper operation of the device or its driver is not compromised.
      Change:
        Added a driver workaround for BCM5751 Shasta devices that reads
        and updates all statistics before it gets rolled over.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ10476 issue.

  2.  Enhancement Request:
        CQ13592 Add 4 ID match for new OEM project.
      Cause:
        New 4 ID match support request by OEM.
      Change:
        Added new 4 ID match for OEM project.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ13592 Enhancement Request.

  3.  Enhancement Request:
        CQ13678 5702FE should not be supported in the AMD64 INF.
      Cause:
        The 5702FE Device support in AMD64 INF installation file was a
        left over from earlier time.
      Change:
        Removed 5702FE Device support in AMD64 INF installation file.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ13678 Enhancement Request.

  4.  Enhancement Request:
        CQ13693 Add 4 ID match for new OEM project.
      Cause:
        New 4 ID match support request by OEM.
      Change:
        Added new 4 ID match for OEM project.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ13693 Enhancement Request.

  5.  Enhancement Request:
        CQ13715 Mirror OEM desktop customers PCI ID's into the Broadcom
        INF installation files.
      Cause:
        OEM request to have device support in Broadcom generic INF files.
      Change:
        Copied 4 ID device supports from OEM INF files to Broadcom INF files.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ13715 Enhancement Request.

  6.  Enhancement Request:
        Add support for new ASF driver keep alive message.
      Cause:
        New design requirement.
      Change:
        Added keep alive message to ASF firmware to the driver's timer
        tick routine.
      Impact:
        None.

  7.  Enhancement Request:
        CQ13720 Add multiple 4 ID matches for new OEM mobile projects.
      Cause:
        New 4 ID match support requests by OEM.
      Change:
        Added new 4 ID matches for OEM mobile projects.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ13720 Enhancement Request.

  8.  Enhancement Request:
        CQ13779 Program DMA Read Write Control Register on 5714/5715
      Cause:
        Errata on device.
      Change:
        Set bit 15 and clear bit 14 of dma read write control register.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ13779 issue.

  9.  Problem:
        CQ12862. The core clock could be slowed on 5751M Ax-step devices.
      Cause:
        The driver was slowing the core clock when a 5751M family Ax-step part is
        linked at 10mb.  This could cause a performance issue with TPM if TPM were
        enabled.  This problem could only occur on mobile ("M") devices. The driver
        should only slow the core clock at 10mb with 5751 Bx-step devices.
      Change:
        Leave the core clock at regular speed when 5751M Ax device is linked
        at 10mb.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ12862 issue.



Version 8.39  July 20, 2005
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        It could take a 5703/4 device, or the LAN core in a 5714/5715 device
        10ms to respond to a PCI read transaction to register 0x468 when
        WOL was disabled and the system was shutdown. This issue is related to
        CQ 13332 issue.
      Cause:
        When WOL is disabled, and ASF/IPMI are disabled, the driver will
        power-down the GPHY.  This turns off the clock to register 0x468 on these
        devices. This could introduce a 10ms delay if the driver later accesses
        this register. In most cases, this delay is benign.  However, if the
        5703/4 device is behind a upstream PCIE-PCIX bridge, the upstream device
        could have a completion timer timeout enabled.  If the upstream device
        did have such a timer, a failure could be seen that would be similar to
        CQ 12100 (which was related to the 5751 family and was already worked
        around in SW).
      Change:
        Updated driver to only write to register 0x468 in the shutdown code path if
        WOL is enabled via NVRAM setting.
      Impact:
        Works around part of CQ 13332 issue. There should be no side-effects.

  2.  Problem:
        When the core clock is slowed on a 5704 device, or when the core
        clock is slowed on 5714/5715 LAN core, it could take the device up to
        10ms to respond to a PCI target read transaction. This issue is
        related to CQ 13332.
      Cause:
        5703/4 and 5714/5715 devices have a known HW errata related to
        target read accesses that occur after the core clock has been slowed.
        The workaround of the known errata was to either read registers twice,
        or to re-order code so such that read data would be relied upon
        after slowing the core clock.  However, this older workaround could
        still result in a 10ms delay to respond to a target read, and if the
        5704 device is behind a upstream PCIE-PCIX bridge, the upstream device
        could have a completion timer timeout enabled.  If the upstream device
        did have such a timer, a failure could be seen.
      Change:
        Updated driver to not issue memory-mapped read requests after slowing
        the core clock on certain devices (e.g. 5703, 5704, 5714, 5715).
      Impact:
        Works around part of CQ 13332. There should be no side-effects.

  3.  Problem:
        CQ13135 5702 does not pass WHQL 2m_WOLPattern test.
      Cause:
        Driver change done for CQ12875 in release v8.33 is causing the 5702
        to not recognize the first interesting wakeup packet received.
      Change:
        Backed out change for CQ12875 for this release so this release can
        continue. CQ12875 will be characterized further.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ13135 issue, CQ12875 remains unresolved.



Version 8.38  July 20, 2005
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ13477 OID_GEN_XMIT_OK and OID_GEN_RCV_OK do not return correct
        values for null buffer queries during Windows HCT 1c_64BitOIDs test.
      Cause:
        Driver change done for CQ13358 in release v8.37 caused this issue;
        such that zero length buffer queries were accepted by the v8.37
        driver and returned 4 bytes of data.
      Change:
        Updated driver code for Windows DDK MiniportQueryInformation function
        so that it does not return any data for zero length buffer sizes and
        reports Buffer was too short.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ13477 issue.



Version 8.37  July 18, 2005
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ13358 Broadcom MIB statistic field shows zero for MIB SNMP Query
        Statistics OID operations.
        Driver versions 8.14 to 8.36 (and 7.99 to 7.108 sustaining) returned
        zero to MIB SNMP Query Statistics OID operations.
      Cause:
        The combination of driver code path in versions listed above for
        handling of  Windows DDK MiniportQueryInformation function, coupled
        with the fact that upper layer SW was making a SNMP based query using
        a query with a buffer size of 7 bytes data size for the Statistic OIDs;
        resulted in driver returning a buffer size indication of 7 bytes,
        which was interpreted by upper layer SW as having a final value of
        zero, because the size of the buffer returned should have been 4 bytes
        or 8 bytes depending on the OID in question.
      Change:
        Modified Driver implementation for Windows DDK MiniportQueryInformation
        function Statistics OIDs; so that it returns 4 bytes of data if Query
        data size was 1 to 7 bytes or 8 bytes if the Query data size was 8
        bytes or larger. This is per Windows DDK MiniportQueryInformation
        function specification.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ13358 issue.

  2.  Enhancement Request:
        Add force link configuration for 5714S/5715S serdes/fiber based devices.
      Cause:
        5714S/5715S serdes/fiber based devices may not get link if
        auto-negotiation option is disabled by the switch.
      Change:
         For 5714S/5715S serdes/fiber based devices, driver will force to
         1000Gbps full duplex mode if the link can't be established but link
         energy has been detected and no configuration words were received from
         the switch.
      Impact:
         Resolve CQ13005, 13122 issues.
         This change only affects 5714S/5715S serdes/fiber based devices. It
         has no impact if auto-negotiation is enabled by the switch. It does
         not affect GPHY based devices.

  3.  Problem:
        CQ12910   5714S A1 fails 2c_OffloadCheckSum NDIS test intermittently.
      Cause:
        5714S and  5715S Fiber devices require different sequencing of PHY
        register settings, and modifications to reset handling.
      Change:
        Reordered setting of PHY registers such that the advertisement register
        is written first and then Auto Negotiation is initiated.   Also
        modified the OS initiated reset routine to change how OS initiated
        resets are handled on 5714S and 5715S devices.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ12910 issue.

  4.  Problem:
         CQ13463 Invalid Data in OEM Driver INF file for XP32
      Cause:
         OEM specific installation file for XP32 had errors in details of
         driver name to be installed. The Broadcom b57win32.inf file did not
         have this issue.
      Change:
         Updated OEM specific installation file with correct driver name to
         be installed for OEM devices with 4 part PCI ID matching.
      Impact:
         Resolve CQ13463 issue.



Version 8.36  July 11, 2005
----------------------------------------

  1.  Problem:
        CQ13290, CQ13155 Diagnostic memory tests fail randomly.
      Cause:
         A change introduced into 8.32 to reduce OID stack usage inadvertently
         allocated only one temporary memory buffer for all loaded devices as
         opposed to allocating one temporary memory buffer for each loaded
         device.
      Change:
         Moved OID temporary buffer allocation from being statically declared
         to the device instance data structure.
      Impact:
         Resolve CQ13290, CQ13155 issues.

  2.  Enhancement Request:
        CQ13286 Add hidden registry key to disable advertisement of 1000mb.
      Change:
         Added hidden registry key "DisableGig". When this key is set
         to a non-zero value, the device driver will program the device
         to not advertise 1000mb.
      Impact:
         Resolve CQ13286 issue.

  3.  Enhancement Request:
        CQ13345 Add 4 ID match for new OEM project.

      Cause:
        New 4 ID match support request by OEM.
      Change:
        Added new 4 ID match for OEM project.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ13094 issue.

  2.  Enhancement Request:
        CQ13163 Add five new 4 ID match device support for OEM projects.
      Cause:
        Request for new 4 ID match support  by OEM.
      Change:
        Added five new 4 ID match device support for OEM project.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ13163 issue.

  3.  Enhancement Request:
        CQ13188 Add 4 ID match for new OEM project.
      Cause:
        New 4 ID match support request by OEM.
      Change:
        Added new 4 ID match for OEM project.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ13188 issue.

  4.  Problem:
        CQ13145 NDIS 5.1 Driver v8.34 Installation INF file had internally
        identified a 5789 device as a 5788 device.
        This resulted in 5789 device getting the same installation parameters
        as a 5788 device.
      Cause:
         Device identification error in v8.34 AMD64 INF installation file.
      Change:
         Corrected device identification error in prior AMD64 INF installation
         file.
      Impact:
         Resolve CQ13145 issue.

  5.  Problem:
        CQ12894  Need to disable LSO for 5789 device in AMD64 INF file.
        Need to add Registry Delete of old LSO option for 5789 devices in
        AMD64 platform that had 8.30 driver installed.
      Cause:
        LSO option in Registry stays during a driver upgrade, unless it is
        specifically removed.  To avoid uninstall and reinstall of device
        driver to update Registry, driver version 8.35 should delete LSO
        option from prior installation.
      Change:
        Removed LSO option for 5789 in INF install file and added Registry
        delete of unintentional LSO option from prior release of driver.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ12894 issue.

  6. Request:
        CQ9270 Enable LSO Advanced Option for 5788 devices in AMD64
      Change:
        Enabled LSO Advanced Option for 5788 devices in AMD64 Install INF file.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ9270 issue.

  7.  Problem:
        CQ13203  5752A1 Fails WHQL ACPI Stress Test for HCT12.1
      Cause:
        A change introduced in v8.31 to power off the phy on 5752 family
        parts when wol is disabled and asf is disabled caused the failure.
      Change:
        Commented out code for 5752 family parts that powers off the phy and
        revert back to the autophy power down power saving scheme.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ13203 issue.




Version 8.34  June 07, 2005
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ12733 Incorrect MAC address on WinPE boot via PXE
    Cause:
        When the device driver is loaded with PXE active, the driver
        would reset the controller with the controller's memory arbiter
        disabled.
    Change:
        Modified the driver to not disable the controller's memory arbiter
        when issuing a device reset.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ12733 issue.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ13072 Don't switch to VAUX power on 5714 and 5715 NICs
    Cause:
        Too much VAUX power is drawn from the system, when driver
        switches NIC from Main PCI-E power to VAUX PCI-E power.
        This is problem is specific and limited to 5714 and 5715 NICs
    Change:
        Modified the driver so that it does not switch 5714/5715 NIC
        power from Main to VAUX and only uses Main PCI-E power.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ13072 issue.



Version 8.33  June 02, 2005
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ13032 Incorrect friendly name for 5714s and 5715s on NT 4.0
    Cause:
        New device support addition in 8.32 needed distinction for copper
        and fiber interfaces.
    Change:
        Modified NT4 NDIS4 Installation INF file to correctly install copper
        and fiber versions of 5714 and 5715 Adapters.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ13032 issue.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ12899 WinPE locks up when driver is loaded via RIS
    Cause:
        The device driver was initializing the device incorrectly when cleaning
        up after PXE by issuing commands to the ASF firmware when ASF is not
        loaded.
    Change:
        Removed commands to ASF during PXE cleanup.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ12899 issue.

  3.  Enhancement Request:
        CQ13062 Add 4 ID match support for OEM new project.
      Cause:
        New 4 ID match support request by OEM.
      Change:
        Added new 4 ID match for OEM project.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ13062 issue.

  4.  Problem:
        CQ12929 5714S A1 cannot establish link when connected to Dell
        PowerConnect 5224 switch
    Cause:
        The switch does not advertise full duplex. By default, the
        chip/firware/driver only advertized full duplex, leading to a failure
        to connect.
    Change:
        Changed the driver to advertise half duplex also.
      Impact:
        None.

  5.  Problem:
        CQ12970 LE 5780S  A4 and Connection to Switch Causes Increased CPU
        Utilization
    Cause:
        The device ID was not recognized by the driver, so the driver was
        incorrectly treating the device as a copper device, not a fiber device.
    Change:
        Added the new ID to the check list in the driver, to allow the driver
        to program the device correctly.
      Impact:
        None.

  6.  Problem:
        CQ12875 - The controller would link at 10mb when the driver is
        disabled in windows and WOL speed in the control panel is set
        10mb. The expected behavior is for the controller to link at
        the speed specified in nvram when the driver is disabled.
      Cause:
        The driver was not correctly configuring the WOL speed when
        the driver's halt routine was called when the driver is disabled.
      Change:
        Modified driver to correctly configure the WOL speed based on
        nvram setting when the driver's halt routine was called.
      Impact:
        There is no known negative impact of this change.


Version 8.32  May 26, 2005
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ12622 5704-B0 with Jumbo Frame: One port stops responding
        within 2 hrs when passing Chariot traffic to both ports concurrently.
      Cause:
        This problem only occurs when both jumbo frames
        and LSO are both enabled and in use.  This problem also only occurs
        on 5704, and not on 5703, 5705, or other 57xx controller.
        There is race condition in the LSO firmware that can cause a
        dead-lock where firmware waits forever for state machine to
        become IDLE before moving on.
        This causes firmware to hang up and back pressure all other
        state machines which in turn prevents the device to further
        transmit and receive traffic.
    Change:
        Modified 5704 LSO firmware to prevent the dead-lock condition.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ12622 issue. There should be no side-effects of the fix.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ12894  Need to disable LSO for 5789 device in AMD64 INF file.
        Need to add Registry Delete of old LSO option for 5789 devices in
        AMD64 platform that had 8.30 driver installed.
      Cause:
        LSO option in Registry stays during a driver upgrade, unless it is
        specifically removed.  To avoid uninstall and reinstall of device driver
        to update Registry, driver version 8.32 should delete LSO option from
        prior installation.
      Change:
        Removed LSO option for 5789 in INF install file and added Registry
        delete of unintentional LSO option from prior release of driver.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ12894 issue.

  3.  Problem:
        CQ12983 Not able to complete installation of 5714c on NT 4 system.
      Cause:
        New devices: 5714c, 5714s, 5715c, 5715s were not supported until tested.
      Change:
        Added new device 5714c, 5714s, 5715c, 5715c support.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ12983 issue.

  4.  Problem:
        CQ12910 5714S A1 fails 2c_OffloadCheckSum NDIS test.
      Cause:
        New 5714s, 5715s Fiber device support not fully implemented.
      Change:
        Added new 5714s , 5715s Fiber device support.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ12910 issue.

  5.  Enhancement Request:
        NdisQueryBufferSafe was being called while holding a spinlock in
        the send packet routine.
      Change:
        Reordered routine the routine that was calling NdisQueryBufferSafe
        to not hold a spinlock. This change was made to confirm to Microsoft
        DDK specifications.
      Impact:
        There are no known issues with this change.


Version 8.31  May 17, 2005
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ12857  Flow control is not functional on 5714/5715s Fiber Adapter.
        When 5714/5715s Fiber is interfacing  to a slow 10 Mbs client; it
        would not observe Transmit Pause from the slow client and keep
        sending packets. This would result in a very low interface speed
        between the 1 Gbps fiber 5714/5715s device and the 10 Mbps client.
      Cause:
        Driver support for 5714/5715s Fiber was not using proper register
        selection to read and set Flow Control propreties.
      Change:
        Updated driver to use latest register data to read and set 5714/5715s
        Fiber Flow Control properties.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ12857 issue.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ12894  Need to disable LSO for 5789 device in AMD64 INF file.
      Cause:
        LSO option was made available for 5789 by error in INF install file.
      Change:
        Removed LSO option for 5789 in INF install file.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ12894 issue.

  3.  Enhancement Request:
        CQ12862  Add power management support for Shasta BX and CX.
      Change:
        Enable DLL power-down on Shasta BX and CX Parts.
        Select 6.25Mhz core clock on 5751M BX and CX parts when ASF is disabled
        and linked at 10mb.
        Allow Wake-on-Link on Shasta CX parts for required OEMs.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ12862 issue.

  4.  Enhancement Request:
        CQ12863  Add power management support for 5752M.
      Change:
        Enable DLL power-down on 5752M if ASF is disabled.
        Select 6.25Mhz core clock on 5752M when ASF is disabled and linked
        at 10mb.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ12863 issue.

  5.  Enhancement Request:
        CQ12392  Format and organize the AMD64 INF similar to the XP32 INF.
      Change:
        Formatted and organize the XP32 INF similar to the AMD64 INF
        install file.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ12392 issue.

  6.  Problem:
        5714/5715 family  NICs (not LOMs) could be configured to
        draw from Vaux power if the drivers for both ports were loaded, then
        then disabled, and then one of the ports was re-enabled. In this
        specific scenario, the NIC could be configured to draw Vaux power
        even though PCI (main) power was present, and this could potentially
        lead to a case where the NIC drew excessive current (> 600mA) from
        the slot which could exceed the amount of power that some systems
        provide to slots.  This problem is the same as CQ 9992 which was
        resolved for 5704 NICs about a year ago (v7.75).
      Cause:
        Driver did not force GPIO2 HIGH on 5714 NIC designs at initialization
        time.
      Change:
        Modified driver to apply the same fix for CQ 9992 to 5714/5715 as
        was previously applied to 5704 NIC devices in v7.75.  This fix
        involves having the driver force GPIO2 to be HIGH during the
        driver's early initialization code.
      Impact:
        There is no known negative impact of this change.

  7.  Problem:
        Register reads to the 5714/5715 family of devices could return
        incorrect data if the core clock was slowed to 12.5Mhz or 6.25Mhz.
      Cause:
        5714/5715 was designed to only support memory-mapped register reads
        when the PCI clock (133Mhz) was never more than 10X the speed of
        the core clock.  Previous drivers could make a few memory-mapped
        register reads to the 5714/5714 family of devices when the core
        clock was slowed.
      Change:
        Modified driver to not rely on any values read from registers after
        the core clock was slowed to 12.5Mhz.  This involved re-ordering some
        code fragments.
      Impact:
        There is no known negative impact of this change.  It may correct
        a few previous cases where WoL functionality could have failed.

  8.  Problem:
        Register reads to the 5780 family of devices could return incorrect
        data if the core clock was slowed.
      Cause:
        5780 device (like 5714/5715) was designed to only support memory-mapped
        register reads when the PCI clock (133Mhz) was never more than 10X
        the speed of the core clock.  Previous drivers could make a few
        memory-mapped register reads to the 5714/5715 family of devices when
        the core clock was slowed to 12.5Mhz.
      Change:
        Modified driver to never slow the core clock on 5780 devices.
        Slowing the core clock was not a requirement for 5780 devices,
        because power consumption was not a major concern for this chipset.
      Impact:
        Power consumption will be higher because the LAN core clock is not
        slowed on 5780 platforms.  However, this change may correct
        a few previous cases where WoL functionality could have failed.

  9.  Problem:
        Minor hand-shaking problem between the driver and management
        (ASF or IPMI PT) firmware on 5714/5715 and 5780 class of products.
      Cause:
        The driver was not leaving the "NICDRV_STATE_INIT_DONE" flag in
        shared memory on 5714/5715/5780 products when the driver shutdown
        or went into a low power state.  This could potentially cause
        failures related to management FW after the driver shutdown or the
        system went into a low power state.
      Change:
        Modified driver to deposit the "NICDRV_STATE_INIT_DONE" flag in
        shared memory when shutting down or going into a low power state.
      Impact:
        There is no known negative impact of this change.

  10. Problem:
        CQ12862 - Improve power management for Shasta CX step parts.
      Change:
        Allow gphy dll to be powered down when link is not present
        and asf is disabled.
        Select 6.25mhz core clock when linked at 10mb and asf is disabled.
        Allow wake on link feature for required OEM platforms.
      Impact:
        There is no known negative impact of this change.

  11. Problem:
        CQ12863 - Add support for power management mode in 5752M.
      Change:
        Allow gphy dll to be powered down when link is not present
        and asf is disabled.
        Select 6.25mhz core clock when linked at 10mb and asf is disabled.
      Impact:
        There is no known negative impact of this change.



Version 8.30  May 09, 2005
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ11937 5714c , 5714s, 5715c, 5715s, and 5780 Clock Slowing when
        Windows is Shutting down.
      Cause:
        A device limitation in 5714, 5715, 5780 prevents enabling of very slow
        clocks (6.25 Mhz) as compared to other 57xx devices.
      Change:
        All 57xx Driver code paths were reviewed and changed to avoid setting
        the affected devices' clocks to very slow clock.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ11937 issue.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ12830   5714s and 5715s Fiber adapters do not pass Jumbo frame traffic.
      Cause:
        The driver had not enabled 5714s and 5715s Fiber adapter Jumbo frames
        pending hardware compatibility testing completion.
      Change:
        Enabled 5714s and 5715s Fiber adapter Jumbo frames support.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ12830 issue.

  3.  Enhancement Request:
        CQ12728 Support 64 entries in multicast table.
      Change:
        Expanded the multicast table from 34 to 64 entries.
      Impact:
        The ndis driver now supports 64 entries across all windows platforms.
        Resolve CQ12728 issue.

  4.  Problem:
        CQ12871  IA64 Driver v.8.29 showing v8.28 Under File Properties.
      Cause:
        The 8.29 build for XP64 IA64 Release was not done properly,
        as a result of build problem.
      Change:
        Releases 8.30 will have the proper driver file version.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ12871 issue.


Version 8.29  April 22, 2005
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ12597 5714, 5715, 5780: LSO and Jumbo Frame Advanced Options
        are co-existent in NDIS5.1 v8.25 driver version.
      Cause:
        A device limitation in 5714, 5715, 5780 prevents enabling of both LSO
        and Jumbo options at the same time, and driver version 8.25 allowed
        both to get enabled leading to LSO not working when Jumbo option
        was selected.
      Change:
        Modified installation INF files for NDIS5.1 drivers to show and only
        allow LSO or Jumbo to be enabled separately.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ12597 issue.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ9887 5752, 5714 and 5715 have higher than expected BER rates under
        the following conditions:
          a) When the cable is longer than 70 meters; AND
          b) A device is operating at slow corner conditions (low voltage or
             high temp).
        This problem was not observed during normal system level testing.
      Change:
        Programmed the phy on affected devices to adjust the bias current of
        the ADC on the phy.
      Impact:
        Fix BER issue.

  3.  Problem:
        CQ12656 UM_GenTimerFunction not getting cancelled when driver is
        initialized with cable unplugged. This was causing the CPU to stay
        in C3 state for 200ms max, which is not as long as desired.
      Cause:
        Corner case in code that cancels UM_GenTimerFunction when driver is
        initialized with cable unplugged.
      Change:
        Added code to UM_GenTimerFunction to cancel the timer if it is called
        with the cable disconnected.
      Impact:

Version 8.28  April 05, 2005
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ12609 5702a2 has assertion errors running HCT12.1 XP32-SP2
        driver verifier using checked built driver.
        This problem can cause Windows HCT Certification failures with
        checked build driver.  This miniport driver's function UM_Reset which
        can be called by Windows NDIS driver or HCT Certification tests; would
        have to be called in order to show this problem.
        Driver versions that had this problem were 8.24, 8.25, 8.26 and 8.27.
      Cause:
        Modification of 5714 device reset handling in a previous
        driver introduced a bug in the driver where a HW reset
        would not be issued to older 5700, 5701, 5702, and 5703

   Enhancements:
   =============
  1.  Request:
        Under certain circumstances (usually in peer-to-peer configurations),
        the dynamic interrupt coalescing algorithm could occasionally set
        the interrupt coalescing thresholds to values that were sub-optimal.
        This change was related to observations made while investigating
        CQ 7735 and CQ 11231. Due to the fact that network traffic is
        bursty, it is not practical to always be able to set the "perfect"
        interrupt coalescing threshold values at any given time for any
        given workload.  However, this change should help some in some
        conditions.  Even without this change, performance was still
        "good" in the vast majority of cases.
      Change:
        Modified the dynamic interrupt coalescing algorithm.  Used SW packet
        counters rather than HW packet counters.  Added code to wait slightly
        longer for performance to stabilize after interrupt threshold
        parameter changes, and slightly modified the threshold values.
        This change was originally prototyped in the v7.90z driver.
      Impact:
        Performance characteristics could change slightly, especially in
        peer-to-peer configurations.

  4.  Problem:
        CQ12587 Add 4 ID match support for OEM new project.
      Cause:
        New 4 ID match support request by OEM.
      Change:
        Added new 4 ID match for OEM project.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ12587 issue.

  5.  Problem:
        Remove support for 5714, 5715, 5780 controllers.
      Cause:
        The specified controllers are not available.
      Change:
        Removed support for the devices in the inf files.
        Changed device driver to not load on the affected parts.
      Impact:
        None.



Version 8.25  March 26, 2005
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ12524  Checksum failed when ASF writes to NVRAM from windows.
        This problem only occurs on Baxter Device IDs 0x1600 and 0x1601 that
        introduce NVRAM Address Lockout feature for protection of TPM firmware
        and its environment.
      Cause:
        Prior drivers supporting Baxter IDs 0x1600 and 0x1601 did not check
        for new NVRAM hardware address lockout status and tried to access
        NVRAM unconditionally. This resulted in TPM firmware to stop running
        when a configuration change was performed in ASF or TPM configuration
        by use of the Windows Driver NVRAM access functions.
      Change:
        Modified Windows Driver to first check for NVRAM address lockout and
        follow new access arbitration procedure.
        Updated driver for support of all NVRAM devices following a does not
        verify status report on one NVRAM vendor device.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ12524 issue which caused ASF capable NIC or LOM to disappear
        from ASFConfig.exe display screen when a configuration option was changed
        earlier with the same utility.  The configuration update is stored in NVRAM and
        when NVRAM has a checksum failure; it does not get listed anymore in
        ASFConfig.exe utility.



Version 8.24  March 24, 2005
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ12389 Remove PCI 4 part ID match support for OEM.
      Cause:
        Change in OEM project device usage.
      Change:
        Removed PCI 4 part ID match for OEM.

        AMD64 platform Register Read and Write accesses.
        This issue is only applicable to AMD64 systems and
        is a direct result of updated Windows Device Driver Kit (DDK)
        supporting AMD64 driver builds.
      Cause:
        Original DDK and driver implementation did not have
        these macros defined and used.
      Change:
        Added newly defined KeMemoryBarrier() AMD64 DDK
        function call to Broadcom Driver Register memory mapped
        Read and Write accesses.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ12454 issue and conform to the new AMD64 DDK
        Windows Driver specifications.

  4.  Problem:
        CQ12462 System hang or blue screen when ReverseNway is enabled.
        System hang or blue screen when running loopback test on single
        processor systems with multi-processor kernel.
      Cause:
        Fix for CQ12264 did not properly handle spinlock usage on
        single processor systems vs. multi-processor systems.
        Fix for CQ12264 did not properly handle spinlock dependencies
        when the ReverseNway feature was enabled.
      Change:
        Corrected spinlock code in the loopback test to properly qualify
        the releasing and acquiring of PHY_LOCK with the MpTuning variable
        in the MM_IndicateStatus routine.
        Removed references to releasing and acquiring of MAIN_LOCK in the
        MM_IndicateStatus routine.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ12462.

  5.  Problem:
        CQ12517 OEM Device does not show all applicable advanced options.
      Cause:

      Change:
        Modified OEM device support to show all applicable advanced options.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ12517 issue.

  6.  Problem:
        CQ12524  Checksum failed when ASF writes to NVRAM from windows.
        This problem only occurs on Baxter Device IDs 0x1600 and 0x1601 that
        introduce NVRAM Address Lockout feature for protection of TPM firmware
        and its environment.
      Cause:
        Prior drivers supporting Baxter IDs 0x1600 and 0x1601 did not check
        for new NVRAM hardware address lockout status and tried to access
        NVRAM unconditionally. This resulted in TPM firmware to stop running
        when a configuration change was performed in ASF or TPM configuration
        by use of the Windows Driver NVRAM access functions.
      Change:
        Modified Windows Driver to first check for NVRAM address lockout and
        follow new access arbitration procedure.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ12524 issue which caused ASF capable NIC or LOM to disappear
        from ASFConfig.exe display screen when a configuration option was changed
        earlier with the same utility.  The configuration update is stored in NVRAM and
        when NVRAM has a checksum failure; it does not get listed anymore in
        ASFConfig.exe utility.

  7.  Problem:
        CQ12519 Driver to Bootcode handshake during Windows Shutdown
        requires update so that normal and fast boot versions of Bootcode
        can initialize properly in conjunction with Windows Driver loading and
        unloading.
      Cause:
        Original driver implementation in all prior releases.
      Change:
        Modified Windows Driver with updated driver to bootcode handshake
        procedure.

        Add support back for PCI IDs 0x1600, 0x1601, 0x1668, 0x1669,
        0x166A, 0x166B which will install the following Broadcom models:
        BCM5714C, BCM5714S, BCM5780C, BC5780S, BC5752, BCM5752M.
      Change:
        Added the above PCI IDs to all NDIS  INF  installation support files.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ12457 Few Transmit CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) errors seen
        at the Switch counters when Jumbo Frames are enabled and used
        extensively on 57xx Adapters and LOMs.
        These Transmit CRC errors are only applicable when Jumbo Packets
        advanced option is enabled and used. These Transmit CRC errors
        will not be seen by the other system which is receiving the Jumbo
        Packets since the Switch retransmits all frames in between the two
        connected ports.  Cable length and quality are also important factors
        in CRC Transmit errors that are observed by the Switch.
      Change:
        Added setting of PHY Control Register FIFO Elasticity Enable option;
        when Jumbo Packets are enabled on all 57xx NIC and LOM devices.
        This is a minor improvement to reduce and eliminate Transmit CRC
        errors observed at the Switch port connected to the 57xx Device.
      Cause:
        Original Driver implementation did not enable this PHY option.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ12457  issue.

        Resolve CQ12357 issue.



Version 8.22  March 08, 2005
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ12264 Blue screen when running Driver Verifier and control suite
        diags.
      Cause:
        The driver was improperly holding a spinlock during the
        loopback test.
      Change:
        Corrected the driver to release spinlocks during the loopback
        test.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ12264 issue.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ12026 A TPM NVRAM access could fail if driver reset the 575x device
        during the attempted TPM NVRAM access
      Cause:
        The NDIS driver would acquire the NVRAM lock before doing a reset and then
        halt the internal CPU to prevent NVRAM contention between driver and
        bootcode.  However, the driver would then release the NVRAM lock right
        before doing the chip reset.  This left a tiny window of vulnerability
        for the TPM to initiate an NVRAM access right after the driver released
        the NVRAM lock and right before the driver issued a reset to the
        device.  If the driver were to issue a reset while the TPM was trying to
        make an NVRAM access, the reset would cause the TPM NVRAM access to fail,
        which could cause a higher level TPM command to fail.  This problem has
        never been reported by a customer in the field, but was seen doing
        exhaustive low-level testing at Broadcom.
      Change:
        Changed the device driver to acquire nvram lock during device resets for
        5751 and 5752 family of devices (the only devices that support TPM).
      Impact:
        Resolves CQ 12026.  There should be no side effects from this change.


Version 8.21  March 03, 2005
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ12082 Driver Verifier Enable/Disable Test for HCT 12.0 fails for
        7.104 NDIS 5.1 Driver.
      Cause:
        Some RX packets were not processed back into the driver, and driver
        returned successfully from its Halt function.
      Change:
        Added driver wait to get RX packets back from NDIS, prior to returning
        successfully from the driver Halt function.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ12082 issue.

  2.  Problem:
        Remove support for 5752, 5753, 5714, 5715 controllers.

        CQ12149 Network tray icon shows no link after remove CPM and then
        insert DLink ESM.
      Cause:
        The device driver did not turn off hardware autoneg before checking
        if the device is receiving Rx Config word.
      Change:
        Changed the device driver to turn off H/W autoneg before reading
        the MAC status register.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ12149.


Version 8.19  February 16, 2005

----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ 11764, Burned in address shows up as Multicast or wrong address on NICs with
        IPMI.
      Cause:
        The HaltCpu() routine incorrectly releases the Rx/Tx CPU NVRAM grant if it halts
        a CPU currently asserting its NVRAM arbitration request. This is incorrect because
        the driver has no way to know which CPU (Tx or Rx) is currently the NVRAM grant owner,
        and therefore should not issue a dummy read and should not release the grant (see HaltCpu()).
        Also, the driver at various places was issuing a dummy read w/o waiting for the result.
        The above errors break the NVRAM access protocol.
      Change:
         For the 5704 and 5703 chips, _both_ CPUs are halted. All NVRAM reads now wait for
         the result.

      Cause:
        The driver was using a blocking wait Windows kernel call to wait for completion of
        5704 Serdes Fiber port Soft Reset operation.
      Change:
        Modified driver to no longer use blocking Windows kernel call for waiting and wait
        without holding other threads.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ11969 issue.

----------------------------------------
  1. Problem:
        CQ11147 - Performance lower than expected in a few rare test scenarios
        with 5751 family of devices. When this occurred, throughput would
        periodically drop to zero for short periods of time which would lower
        the average throughput. This problem was only seen when running
        high throughput peer-to-peer performance tests with a single Linux
        client.  The issue would not be seen in tests involving multiple
        remote stations, or tests involving Windows clients
      Cause:
        Algorithm to coalesce send producer index updates on 5705 devices
        was also used on 5751 devices.  This is unnecessary on with 5751.
      Change:
        Do not coalesce send producer index updates on 5751 family devices
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ 11147.  There are no side-effects of this change.

        Modified driver to return 4 bytes data for all Dot3Stats OIDs.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ11151 issue.

   4. Problem
       CQ11472 Unstable PLL output can lead to the chip lock-up when
       transitioning to D3 Cold.
       Extremely rare HW lock-up on 5751 devices when going into S3/S4
       that causes the 5751 to intermittently not be visible to the system
       after resuming from S3/S4.
      Cause:
        The lock-up occurs due to an unstable PLL output ,due to internal
        clock switching when PERST# is asserted when entering S3/S4.
      Change:
        Set hardware control register to values that prevent
        Phase Lock Loop to power down & do Core clock switching.
      Impact:
         Higher power consumption in S3/S4 on the 5751 family of devices

  5. Problem:

  6. Problem:
        CQ11453, CQ 11454 - BACS not working correctly under NT 4.
      Cause:
        A change in v7.92 of the driver to address CQ 9949 introduced a new
        problem that occurred only under NT 4 (not on W2K, XP, or W2K3).  The
        new problem was that certain IOCTL calls down to the driver issued
        by BMAPI (on behalf of BACS) would fail, because the driver was no
        longer advertising support for private OIDs due to the change for
        CQ 9949.  NT4 appears to block IOCTL calls for OIDs that are not
        explicitly advertised.
      Change:
        Modified driver advertise all private OIDs in NDIS 4 and NDIS 3.1
        versions of the driver.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ11453 and 11454.  This will not break CQ 9949 because that
        issue was specific to newer operating systems (later than NT 4).

----------------------------------------

 1. Problem:
        CQ10758 TPM - 5751 A4 LOM in OEM system with ASF Enabled fails S1
        Waker/Dozer Test.
      Cause:
        This is due to the driver "resuming" from a sleep state and reading PHY registers
        while the ASF FW could be simultaneously reading those registers.
      Change:
        The fix to this problem is to gracefully stop the internal CPU before making any
        PHY accesses in the "resume" code (the OID_SET_POWER handler).
      Impact:
        None.

 2. Problem:
        CQ10863 GEN_OID_RCV_ERROR is not incrementing when an error packet is received.
      Cause:
        Original driver implementation did not increment this count when Oversized,  Undersized,
        and Jabber packets were received.
      Change:
         Added count of Oversized,  Undersized, and Jabber packets to GEN_OID_RCV_ERROR

      Cause:
        Performance testing shows that Large Send Offload operations can be improved on
        575x devices, by changing the value of this parameter from 8 to 2.
      Change:
        Modified driver to set recommended value to this parameter for 575x devices.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ10991 issue.

  5. Problem:
        CQ10985 System cannot wake with Magic Packet using LAA MAC Network Address
        set with Advanced Options when ASF is also enabled.
      Cause:
        The driver shutdown handler did not update the WOL MAC Network Address with
        custom LAA values in the case of ASF enabled condition.
      Change:
        Modified driver to set custom LAA values accordingly when Windows is doing shutdown.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ10985 issue.

  6. Problem:
        CQ10965 Excessive power consumption on 5751 BX parts when cable is disconnected.

      Cause:
        The driver to ASF handshake and control register sharing needed update for
        proper ASF operation in Standby mode or after wake from Standby.
      Change:
        Updated the driver to do proper ASF handshake and control register sharing
        for resume of ASF PET operation.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ10350 issue.





Version 7.86 August 23, 2004
---------------------------------

 1. Problem:
        CQ10816  CHKINF fails in HCT12 for XP-SP2 installation.

        An install section was missing in the b57win32.inf v7.85 INF file.
      Change:
        Added the missing install section.
      Impact:
        Correct CQ10816 issue.



Version 7.85 August 19, 2004
---------------------------------

 1. Problem:
        CQ10748 The "LargeSendOffload" registry key was being mistakenly added to
        the Windows 2000 registry. This key should not be added to the W2K registry
        because of serious problems with LSO feature in the original release of W2K
        (before the release of the W2K service packs).
        This issue is applicable to the unified install inf file b57win32.inf and only one
        specific OEM with PCI SubSystem ID of 0x1028.
        Prior released versions of b57win32.inf that had this installation issue for OEM
        with SubSystem ID of 0x1028 were 7.76 to 7.84.
      Cause:
        This key was originally present only in the Windows XP INF. However, when
        the Windows 2000 and Windows XP INF files were merged into a single INF,
        the INF was not modified so that this key would only be added on Windows XP
        and not added for Windows 2000.
      Change:
        The unified Windows 2000 and Windows XP INF was modified to not add
        LargeSendOffload key to the registry when the driver is installed on
        Windows 2000.
      Impact:
        No side effects.

2. Problem:
        CQ10781:  OEM System with 57xx PCI-E Device does NMI (blue screen) after
        PXE boot from Venturcom BXP PXE server.
 Cause:
        The root cause of the problem is that the Venturcom BXP PXE Server does not
        shutdown the UNDI driver after PXE boot has completed.
        This problem does not occur with PXE server products from other vendors.
        The 7.84 driver detects during initialization that the LAN device has not been
        shutdown properly by the PXE/UNDI software, and it attempts to gracefully
        workaround this by resetting the device.
        During this attempt to reset the 57xx PCI-E device, the PCI-E link flaps
        (link down/up) which causes an "unexpected link change" on the chipset side.
        Depending on the chipset configuration, this can lead to an NMI.
        This problem only occurs on PCI-E devices, and does not occur on standard PCI devices.
      Change:
        Modified the device driver to gracefully reset 57xx PCI-E devices without causing the
        PCI-E link to go down/up,  in the case that the PXE UNDI driver had not been halted
        at the time of  Windows initialization of the device driver.
      Impact:
        None



Version 7.84 August 05, 2004
---------------------------------

 1. Problem:
        CQ10705  A NMI was observed when a Windows "shutdown" occurred on a  OEM
        5751M LOM based platform running 10mb, with WOL disabled, no ASF enabled.  The
        problem could only occur if WOL was disabled, and the system was running at 10mb.
      Cause:
        The original driver Shutdown sequence (with no WOL and no ASF) powered off the GPHY
        prior to disabling device TX and RX blocks.  The GPHY was powered-down to save
        power. Since the GPHY was disabled, the clock to certain MAC registers was intended
        to be switched to a slower clock derived from the core clock.  However, a bug was
        recently discovered in this logic which could lead to those registers having a very slow
        clock (or no clock) in this situation.  This in turn, could lead to scenarios where read transactions
        to those registers was not completed in a timely manner.  This could cause the chipset to
        assert an NMI after 10ms if the read was not yet completed.  In the failing case, it was
        observed that the read did complete, but it took up to 21ms to complete..
      Change:
        Modified driver to first disable the device RX and TX blocks and then power off the PHY
        if no WOL and ASF were enabled.
      Impact:
        No side effects.


Version 7.83 August 05, 2004
---------------------------------

   1. Problem:
        CQ10672  LAN driver yellow bang, or TPM failure, during focused LAN driver
         halt/re-initialize testing.
      Cause:
        The driver could write to a new NVRAM control register in 5751 HW without
        holding the NVRAM lock.  This coud cause a problem if the TPM function and
        the LAN driver both simultaneously tried to access NVRAM.  This problem is
        highly timing dependent.  Under normal circumstances, the only time that the
        driver acceses NVRAM is when loading the driver.
      Change:
        Re-ordered some code fragments to ensure that Nvram control register
        in question is only accessed while the driver is holding the NVRAM lock.
      Impact:
        This driver is compatible with TPM.


   2. Problem:
        CQ10532  Sychronize AMD 64 device support with XP 32.
      Cause:
            The AMD 64 install inf file did not have OEM PCI ID match for supported device.
      Change:
        Added OEM PCI ID device support to AMD 64 inf install file.
      Impact:
        Fix CQ10532 issue.

      Change:
        Released new DLL with proper copyright date.
      Impact:
         Fix CQ10576 issue.

   5. Problem:
        CQ10575 Broadcom Server CD v7.6.3\b57dtect.dll - wrong DLL file version.
      Cause:
            The DLL released in this CD and v7.81 driver was the same binary as 7.80 which had old file version.
      Change:
        Released new DLL with proper DLL version.
      Impact:
         Fix CQ10575 issue.

   6. Problem:

   8. Problem:
        CQ10539  Broadcom 5788 Device Performance decreased with latest driver compared to previous driver.
      Cause:
        Driver 5788 special dummy register reads at the start of ISR, these were only needed for 5788 A0 chip.
      Change:
        Removed 5788 A0 support, support can be restored by defining POSTED_READ_PATCH in sources.
      Impact:
        Fix CQ10539 issue.

   9. Problem:
        CQ10671  OEM LOM Design Wake On Link Change option does not work; while WOL by IP Ping & MP works OK.
        This problem does not occur on Broadcom evaluation NICs.
      Cause:
        Driver did not set Wake On Link Change option to hardware on one of code paths.
      Change:
        Verified driver now sets Wake On Link Change option whenever the advanced property has selected it.
      Impact:
         Fix CQ10671 issue.

   10. Problem:

         Fix CQ10681 issue.

   11. Problem:
        CQ10691 Running Chariot with 1Byte buffer size causes the interface to hang.
        This problem only occurs when an application attempts to transmit a packet
        that contains a huge number (e.g. hundreds) of very small buffer fragments
        and that it would be highly unusual for a real application to do this.
        This problem was found when using an artificial test scenario that intentionally
        forced this condition.
      Cause:
        The fix for CQ9262 related to highly fragmented transmit packet buffers
        was implemented in the multi-processors code path but was not implemented
        in the single processor code path.
      Change:
        Implemented fix for CQ9262 in the single processor code path.
      Impact:
        Fix CQ10691 issue.

            CQ10317 Using switch -hreset to perform reset adapter continuously overnight,
            system would lock up
      Cause:
            There is an extra write to the T3_PCI_PM_STATUS_CTRL_REG in LM_SetPowerState().
            This problem was introduced while resolving CQ10032 in driver 7.77
      Change:
            Removed the extra write.
      Impact:
            None.

   2. Problem:
            CQ10336 System freezes when changing advanced driver properties on Intel PDK
            PCI-E Slots
      Cause:
            There is an extra write to the T3_PCI_PM_STATUS_CTRL_REG in LM_SetPowerState().

      Impact:
            Lower power consumption for 5750 devices configured for 10mb WakeOnLan.


Version 7.77 June 8, 2004
---------------------------------

   1. Problem:
            CQ9033 Flow control does not work consistantly.
      Cause:
            When the phy is initially powered on, the default behavior
            is to not advertise flow control.
      Change:
            Restart autoneg when flow control is configured to notify
            the link partner that flow control is desired.
      Impact:
            None.


   2. Problem:
            CQ10280 5700 b2 and b3  fails to pass traffic.

            CQ10275 Large Send Offload and IPMI does not co-function on 5721.
      Cause:
            LSO is turned off when ASF is enabled. This was necessary for the 5705
            device which implemented LSO in f/w.
      Change:
            Since LSO is done in h/w, it is not necessary to disable LSO
            when ASF is running on 575x and 572x devices.
      Impact:
            None.

   4. Problem:

      Impact:

   2. Change Request:
            Merge the winXP and win2k inf.
      Cause:
            Requested by MSFT for logo certification.
      Change:
            There is now a single .inf for winXP and win2k. This .inf is called
            b57win32.inf. This distribution still includes the old .inf, so to
            test, instruct windows to use the win32 inf during driver install.
      Impact:
            None.

   3. Problem:
            CQ10151 Server ASRs when running IXIA stress test. The machine appears locked up
            under heavy network load.
      Cause:
            The DPC routine can run for an extended period if the NIC interrupt rate
            is high.
      Change:
            Cap the amount of time the DPC routine can run. The DPC routine was
            aso rewritten to improve clarity.
      Impact:
            None.

   4. Problem:
            CQ10034 Runt packets transmitted on 5700BX are not padded with zeros.
      Cause:
            Archaic workaround code for the 5700AX parts was incorrectly padding
            transmit packets for 5700BX with garbage.
      Change:
            Removed workaround code since 5700AX parts were never released into
            production.
      Impact:
            None.


Version 7.75 May 26, 2004
---------------------------------

   1. Problem:
            CQ10033   5700 B2 LOM with v1.3 Bootcode does not pass traffic
            when v7.73 driver is used.
      Cause:
            The older 5700 v1.3 Bootcode did not implement shared memory
            driver-bootcode interface; so the driver would not recognize nor
            initialize the PHY.
      Change:
            Added a fallback case to driver; so that in case of older bootcodes
            the driver would initialize the PHY for proper operation.
      Impact:
            Fix CQ10033 issue.

   2. Problem:
            CQ9992 5704 nic may draw VAUX during device initialization when

            Incorrect programming of GPIO2 when only one port has been enabled.
      Change:
            Corrected programming of GPIO2.
      Impact:
            5704 nic will not draw from VAUX during device initialization.

   3. Problem:
            CQ10097 OID_GEN_RCV_NO_BUFFER or OID_GEN_RCV_ERROR
            statistics not incremented when packets are dropped.
      Cause:
            OID_GEN_RCV_NO_BUFFER was getting the count from
            lower module's no more receive buffer descriptors.
      Change:
            Modified OID_GEN_RCV_NO_BUFFER to get count from
            lower module's receive overrun counter.
      Impact:
            Fix CQ10097 issue.

   4. Problem:

   9. Problem:
          CQ9960  System will not go to standby properly when a 5705 is
          linked at 10mb.
      Cause:
          When the 5705 is linked at 10mb, the core clock speed is slowed
          to reduce power consumption. When the device driver programs
          the 5705 for Wake On Lan, the 5705 is not programmed properly
          due to the reduced clock speed.
      Change:
          Changed the Wake On Lan configuration code to ensure that the
          core clock speed is set to normal before configuring the part
          for Wake On Lan.
      Impact:
          Fix CQ9960 issue.

   10. Problem:
            CQ10106  System running NT4 may report IERR when saving a speadsheet
            from a Win95/Win98 Client.
      Cause:
            The operating system was presenting zero length buffers to the
            ndis driver for transmission.
      Change:
            Added scan for zero length buffers and coalesce transmit buffers
            that contain zero length buffers.
      Impact:
            Fix CQ10106 new support request.

   11. Change Request:
            CQ8102  Log message to event log when Ethernet@Wirespeed is
            in use.
      Cause:
            New request from OEM.
      Change:
            Added check for Ethernet@Wirespeed status to event logger routine.
      Impact:
            Fix CQ8102 new support request.



Version 7.74 May 20, 2004
---------------------------------

   1. Problem:
            CQ9812   Fiber NIC 5701 has intermittent connectivity at startup.
      Cause:
            Unsuccessful negotiation at startup with fiber switch.
      Change:
            Increased loop attempts to negotiate with fiber switch from two to
            four times and also added initialize of negotiation state machine
            prior to actual negotiation attempt.
      Impact:
            Fix CQ9812 issue.

---------------------------------
   1. Problem:
            CQ9997 ASF 2.0 enabled will not allow system to wake from standby.
      Cause:
            The driver to ASF handshaking does not work as expected when the device
            power state is changed. Specifically, the "last driver state" is not set
            to WoL when it should be. Also, in 7.72, it is possible for the firmware
            to use the WoL pattern table before it is completely setup by the driver.
      Change:
            Fixed the handshaking.
      Impact:



Version 7.72 April 28, 2004
---------------------------------

   1. Problem:
            CQ9989 5751 LOM link is disconnected when changed speed.
      Cause:
            The driver change to correct CQ9124 and CQ9033 Flow Control
            problem did not consider forced speed settings and caused the
            link to disconnect.  Backed out the change for CQ9124 and CQ9033
            until full regression testing has been done. Issues CQ9124 and CQ9033
            will be resolved on a later driver release.
      Change:
            Commented the change for fix of CQ9124 and CQ9033 issues.
      Impact:
            Fix CQ9989 issue.



Version 7.71 April 23, 2004
---------------------------------

   1. Problem:
            CQ9955 Need to remove support for 5751M devices in Release 7.5 on ALL drivers.

            Modified installation inf files to comply with new OEM request.
      Impact:
            Fix CQ9931 issue.

   4. Problem:
            CQ9936  OEM Friendly name is no longer displayed on the Event Viewer Logs.
      Cause:
            The requested friendly name string was too long and it caused Windows to use
            it's own internal name for event logs of 57xx device.
      Change:
            Reduced the OEM friendly name by removing  Controller.
      Impact:
            Fix CQ9936 issue.

            CQ9124 Flow control is not working with 5750 A0 on NT4
            CQ9033   Flow control negotiation fails
      Cause:
            On initial driver load, the flow control capability was not advertised
            to switch link partner.
      Change:
            Added a PHY control write to during device initialization; to advertise
            flow control capability
      Impact:
            Fix CQ9124 and CQ9033 issues.

   Enhancements:
   =============
   1. Request:
            CQ9835 Change behavior of CLKRUN# for 5705 so CLKRUN# is asserted when link

Version 7.69 April 14, 2004
---------------------------------

   1. Problem:
            CQ9613 Set power mode failed in TestApp.exe (Broadcom's internal test
            program needed to test Reverse Nway and Power Save Mode operations).
      Cause:
           A spin lock acquired by the driver when configuring the hardware for
           power saving mode may not be released, causing the OS to lock up. This
           lock up only occurred when the driver was configured for power saving mode
           and the EEPROM "Power Save Mode" option (secfg option 38) was disabled.
      Change:
            The driver was modified to release the spin lock for all code paths in
            the T3_OID_SET_POWER_MODE OID handler.
            This same problem was also detected in the T3_OID_PHY_ON OID handler,
            and so the problem was fixed here also.

---------------------------------

   1. Problem:
            CQ9548 WinXP 5701A3 fails PCI Compliance test in HCT 12.0 Beta 2 Test Kit
      Cause:
            The driver would always assume that OOB WOL was enabled and therefore would
            always set the PME# bit in pci config space.
      Change:
            Changed driver to read OOB WOL configuration directly from eeprom.
      Impact:
            Fix CQ9548 issue.

            CQ9481 5751: Share traffic/link LED not working correctly in XP.
            CQ9549 5751-A1: Driver overwrites LED settings from NVRAM.
      Cause:
            The Windows driver was not keeping Firmware initialized LED settings.
      Change:
            Modified driver to honor the Firmware set LED controls.
      Impact:
            Fix CQ9148, CQ9481, and CQ9549 issues.

   2. Problem:
            CQ9435 Jumbo frames was not functioning in drivers v7.57 to v7.60
      Cause:
            The driver was not keeping Advanced Option Jumbo Frame size as user specified.

            Modified driver to use Memory Writes for 575x devices and Configuration Writes for all other devices.
      Impact:
            Fix CQ9551 issue.

   4. Problem:
            CQ9603 WinXP .inf missing line for OEM customer.
      Cause:
            Incomplete driver installation inf file.
      Change:
            Corrected driver install inf file.
      Impact:

   5. Problem:
            CQ9129 Adapter stops transmitting packets on ia64 and amd64 systems with more
            than 4gb of memory.
      Cause:
            On 64-bit operating systems it is possible to get transmit buffers from
            the upper layers that span a 4gb boundary. The 57xx family of adapters are
            not able to dma buffers that span a 4gb boundary and therefore the read
            dma engine will hang.
      Change:
            Added code to double buffer transmit buffers that span a 4gb boundary
            for all 57xx adapters.
      Impact:
            Fix CQ9129 issue.



Version 7.64 Mar 5, 2004
-----------------------------

   1. Problem:
            CQ9571 Version 7.63 binaries contains incorrect file version information.
      Cause:
            The 7.63 binaries were built incorrectly.

      Impact:
            None.

   2. Problem:
            The ASF firmware is not able to access nic memory when WOL is enabled on
    575X adapters.
      Cause:
            The driver did not properly configure the Mac Control Mode register when
            WOL is enabled on a 575X.
      Change:
            Corrected WOL code to properly configure Mac Control Mode register on
            575X.
      Impact:
            None.

   3. Problem:
            CQ9505 Add option in advance options to allow disable of warning and informational logs
            for a specific OEM customer's 4 part PCI ID set.

            Original driver implementation.
      Change:
            Add new inf entry for OEM 4 part PCI ID and also modify driver to look for and
            handle new Warning/Information Advanced Options.
      Impact:
            Fix CQ9505




Version 7.63 Mar 1, 2004
-----------------------------

   1. Problem:
            Performance is not optimized for TCP/IP traffic.
      Cause:
            TCP/IP data throughput is decreased by 5% when receive frame TCP payload
            is not aligned on a 64-byte cache line boundary. This occurs on both x86
            and AMD platforms.
      Change:
           Changed the internal offset in receive buffers to align the TCP payload on
           a 64-byte boundary. Except for 5701/PCI-X and 5700/PCI-X, the default internal
           receive buffer offset for all NIC's is now 10-bytes. Assuming 54-bytes are used for
           the MAC, IP and TCP headers, a 10-byte offset will put the TCP payload
           on a 64-byte boundary. The internal receive buffer offset for 5701/PCI-X and 5700/PCI-X
           NIC's will always be forced to 0 and cannot be overridden.

      Impact:
          Improved receive performance with TCP/IP frames.



Version 7.62 Feb 25, 2004
-----------------------------

   1. Problem:

Missing support for Shasta A1 various device PCI IDs.

      Cause:

Missing support for Shasta A1 various device PCI IDs.

      Change:

    Changed driver installation inf file to support added IDs.

      Impact:

None.


Version 7.61 Feb 25, 2004
-----------------------------

   1. Problem:

        Missing support for Shasta A1.

      Cause:

      Change:

        Disabled all A0 specific workarounds on A1 chips.

        Changed driver for 5751 A1 by disabling PCIE reset during GRC reset.

        Changed driver for 5751 A1 by enabing PCIE data fifo bug fix in the chip.

      Impact:

        None.

Version 7.60 Feb 18, 2004
-----------------------------
   1. Problem:
    CQ9390, Remove HP mobile PCI entries from Broadcom standard .inf files.
      Cause:
         Installation inf file needed update.
      Change:
         Update installation inf file.
      Impact:
            None.

   2. Problem:
    CQ9420, Friendly name displays "%BCM5750A1% instead of
                      "Broadcom NetXtreme Gigabit Eithernet"
      Cause:
         Installation inf file needed update.
      Change:
         Update installation inf file.
      Impact:
            None.


Version 7.59 Feb 12, 2004
-----------------------------
   1. Problem:
            CQ9262, Database file transfer come to a stop, ARP show 0's MAC address.
      Cause:
            There was a corner case in the descriptor count check in SendPacketsMP().

            This corner case in the NIC driver can occur only if the packet data received
            from the upper layer is extremely fragmented. For example, one packet, which
            triggered this corner case contained 563 bytes, but was fragmented across 511
            4K pages, each containing one or two bytes. One of our OEM Java database
            applications generated this type of packet. When the driver fails in this mode,
            the NIC can still receive but will not transmit. The NIC will also increment the
            NoSendBdLeft statistic counter for each packet transition attempt. Usually,
            the NIC driver cannot be disabled and the Windows desktop freezes.

Version 7.58 Feb 11, 2004
-----------------------------
   Fixes:
   =======
   1. Problem:
            Driver may not initialize properly when PXE is enabled.
      Cause:
            If PXE is not shutdown properly, the hardware will be left
            in a state that is not compatible with the driver's initialization
            routine.
      Change:
            Added code the check to see if the hardware has been left in a
            active state during the driver's load routine and reset the adapter
            if needed.
      Impact:
            None.

   2. Problem:
            CQ9129, 5700/5704 may hang on systems with more than 4gb of ram.
      Cause:
            There were several corner cases in the 4gb workaround code related to
            extremely small or extremely large transmit buffers.
      Change:
            Removed corner cases.
      Impact:
            None.

   3. Problem:
            CQ9262, Database file transfer come to a stop, ARP show 0's MAC address.
      Cause:
            There was a corner case in the descriptor count check in SendPacketsMP().

            This corner case in the NIC driver can occur only if the packet data received
            from the upper layer is extremely fragmented. For example, one packet, which
            triggered this corner case contained 563 bytes, but was fragmented across 511
            4K pages, each containing one or two bytes. One of our OEM Java database
            applications generated this type of packet. When the driver fails in this mode,
            the NIC can still receive but will not transmit. The NIC will also increment the

Version 7.34 November 17, 2003
-----------------------------

   Fixes:
   =======
   1. Problem:
            CQ8781 - No check for NULL from NdisQueryBufferSafe in Ndis 5.1 drivers
      Cause:
    Bug in code that calls NdisQueryBufferSafe
      Change:
            Implemented a buffer prescan to insure that packet buffers are mapped before
            attempting to process a packet. If any buffers are not mapped, fail the request
            gracefully.
      Impact:
            None.

   2. Problem:
            CQ8781 - Use NdisQueryBufferSafe instead of NdisQueryBuffer in Windows 2000
            Ndis 5.0 drivers in oem specific builds
      Cause:
    Code was implemented to use NdisQueryBuffer
      Change:
            Implemented a buffer prescan to insure that packet buffers are mapped before
            attempting to process a packet. If any buffers are not mapped, fail the request
            gracefully.
      Impact:
            Oem specific builds of the Ndis 5.0 driver will not load on Windows98.

   3. Problem:
            The nic will drop frames if the ethernet length field is inconsistent.
      Cause:
    The nic was programmed to drop frames containing a inconsistent ethernet
            length field.
      Change:
            Disabled ethernet length field checking in the hardware.
      Impact:
            None.

   Fixes:
   =======
   1. Problem:
             CQ 8625 5705 A3 programmed with new ID (14e4 1654 103c 3100) is not recognized by 7.32
             OEM specific build.
      Cause:
            Incorrect OEM specific NT4 inf.
      Change:
            Corrected the inf
      Impact:
             None.

   2. Problem:
             Multiple Mac Address (MMA) feature is only accepting two MMA addresses when it should
             accept three.
      Cause:
            Incorrect #define value in source file.
      Change:
            Corrected #define value
      Impact:
             None.


Version 7.32 October 15, 2003
-----------------------------

   Fixes:
   =======
   1. Problem:
             CQ 8497, 5705 A3 programmed with new ID (14e4 1654 103c 3100) is not recognized by 7.31

      Cause:
            Incorrect NT4 inf.

             None.


Version 7.31 October 13, 2003
-------------------------
   Fixes:
   =======
   1. Problem:
             CQ 8497, 3 of 24 NIC reported a high Transmit Queue Length
             in 72 hours stress test.
      Cause:
            The OID handler is using an incorrect structure (big endian)
            which causes the wrong dword to be incremented to reflect the
            Q len.
      Change:
            Switched to the correct stucture
      Impact:
             None.

   2. Problem:
             Fix CQ8545, OEM certification test fails with 7.15 driver but
             passes with 6.67
      Cause:
             Incorrect chip rev. identification in MM_GetConfig() prevented
             TxCoalesce buffers from being allocated for some 5704s
      Change:
             Fixed MM_GetConfig()
      Impact:
             None

   3. Problem:
             CQ7502, LargeSend Offload (LSO) capabilities differ in 5705
             from the rest.

   Enhancements:
   =============
   1. Request:
             Do not set the PME_EN bit in PCI configuration space if OOB WOL
             is not enabled in the nvram when the driver is unloaded.
      Change:
             Added check in the unload routine to not set the PME_EN bit
             when the driver is unloaded.
      Impact:
             None.

   2. Request:
             Add support for 5705F
      Change:

   Enhancements:
   =============
   1. Request:
             Add one key to control both phy auto-negotiation enable/disable and
             desired link speed.
      Change:
             Defined new values for 'RequestedMediaType' that specifies both
             auto-negotiation enable/disable and desired link speed.
      Impact:
             None.

   2. Request:
             Add support for multiple mac addresses on the same nic for the Ndis5.0
             driver.
      Change:
             Changed compile flags to compile multiple mac address support in the
             Ndis5.0 driver.
      Impact:
             None.

Version 7.15 Aug 29, 2003
-------------------------
   Fixes:
   =======
   1. Problem:
             The network icon may intermittently disappear when changing driver
             properties when PowerMon is loaded and QOS is enabled.
      Cause:
             The driver was incorrectly restarting phy auto-negotiation excessively
             causing the driver to take too long to report link up to the operating
             system.
      Change:
             Added code to only restart phy auto-negotiation when there is a change
             in the state of ReverseNway.
      Impact:
             None.

   Enhancements:
   =============
   1. Request:
             Add "volatile" modifier to SendPass and DpcPass driver variables to
             prevent the compiler from optimizing references in ia64 and amd64
             environments.
      Change:
             Added "volatile" modifier to SendPass and DpcPass driver in ia64
             and amd64.
      Impact:
             None.


Version 7.14 Aug 28, 2003

   =============
   1. Request:
             Add support for multiple mac addresses on the same nic.
      Change:
             Added registry keys and custom OIDs to allow third party software
             to configure the nic with multiple mac addresses.
      Impact:
             None.


Version 7.13 Aug 25, 2003
-------------------------
   Fixes:
   =======
   1. Problem:
             The crc error counter for 5700 and 5701 was not getting zeroed
             out when T3_OID_RESET_STATS_COUNTERS is called.
      Cause:
             The crc error counter for 5700 and 5701 was not getting zeroed out
             when the OID call is made.
      Change:
             Added code to zero out the crc error counter for 5700 and 5701 when
             T3_OID_RESET_STATS_COUNTERS is called.
      Impact:
             None.

   2. Problem:
             The retail WinXp32, WinXp64, AMD64 drivers were being compiled with
             incorrect compiler flags.
      Cause:
             The build environment was not configured correctly.
      Change:
             Corrected the retail build environment of the affected operating
             systems to use the correct compiler flags.
      Impact:
             Executables will be slightly smaller.


Version 7.12 Aug 20, 2003
-------------------------
   Fixes:
   =======
   1. Problem:
             Driver Verifier complains about a possible deadlock problem.
      Cause:
             The driver was holding a spinlock during Ndis calls in the send
             path.
      Change:
             Removed spinlocks during Ndis calls in the send path.
      Impact:
             None.

   2. Problem:
            System fault under heavy network load (verifier C4_31)
      Cause:
            The driver may incorrectly use spin locks at ISR level
      Change:
            Remove all calls to acquire spin locks from the ISR.

   3. Problem:
            Improper use of spin lock in shutdown handler
      Cause:
            The driver is using a spin lock in the shutdown handler
      Change:
            Remove calls to acquire spin locks from shutdown handler

Version 7.11 Aug 15, 2003
-------------------------
   Fixes:
   =======
   1. Problem:
             The OID_GEN_RCV_OK statistic incorrectly included receive
             overrun frames.
      Cause:
             The driver needs to subtract the number of receive overrun
             frames from the values reported by hardware.
      Change:
             The driver subtracts the number of receive overrun frames from
             the value reported by hardware before reporting the statistic
             to Windows.
      Impact:
             None.

   Enhancements:
   =============

             None.


Version 6.82 Aug 5, 2003
-------------------------

   1. Problem:
             Incorrect operation after PHY loopback test. Reported against
             Linux configuration.
      Cause:
             PHY register 0x18 is not programmed properly after running the external
             loopback test.
      Change:
             Changed the value written to PHY register 0x18 from 0x480 to
             the correct value 0x400 (after external loopback test).
      Impact:
             None.

   2. Problem:
              Flow control does not function (CQ8181).
      Cause:
              LM_SetupCopperPhy() does not always program the flow control
              when the link comes up.
      Change:
              Program the flow control in all code paths when the link comes up.
      Impact:
              None.

   3. Problem
              Idle cycle fix in 5704 B0 has side effects on certain HP/CPQ
              servers.
      Cause:

      Impact:
               None.

   2. Request:
               Enable hardware fixes in 5704_Bx parts for known erratas.

      Change:
               Added code to driver init routines to enable hardware fixes in
               5704 B0 silicon.  See 5704 errata for more details info about
               the changes/fixes in B0 silicon.


      Impact:
               None.

   Fixes:
   =======
   1. Problem:
              AMD Solo System intermittently blue screens when installing driver for 5704
              CQ8190.

      Cause:
              The driver is executing pageable code at high IRQ level (UM_Initialize()).

      Change:
              Isolated the code executing at high IRQ level to a non pageable routine.

      Impact:
              None.


Version 6.69 July 9, 2003
-------------------------
   Fixes:
   =======
   1. Problem:
              In Windows Win98SE: System cannot go into sleep mode when "wake up frame" is set

      Cause:
              Win98SE expects WakeOnLan capability of  MagicPacket  as well  as  WakeUpFrame
              during its query of  OID_PNP_CAPABILITIES; even if device Advanced Properties is set to
              WakeUpFrame only.

      Change:
              Added setting of MagicPacket support during handling of OID_PNP_CAPABILITIES.

      Impact:
              This change does not affect actual WOL function as specified in the Advanced Properties
              of the device, and only allows Win98SE systems to go to Standby mode.

   2. Problem:
              5700BX will stop processing packets under heavy loads.

      Cause:
              A CoalesceNow workaround for stale status block information on the 5705 was
              causing the 5700BX to hang.

      Change:
              Qualified the CoalesceNow workaround to be applied to only the 5705.

      Impact:
              None.


Version 6.68 June 19, 2003
-------------------------
   Fixes:
   =======
   1. Problem:
              The adapter doesn't drop link when WOL is disabled and the driver
              is disabled.
              If WOL is enabled and the adapter is linked at 1gb when the driver
              is put into low power state, the adapter does not re-acquire link
              at 1gb when the driver resumes.

      Cause:
              A typo in v6.65 of the driver was causing the driver to assume that
              ASF is always enabled.
              A change in v6.65 of the driver was causing the driver to not restart
              link autonegociation on resume.

      Change:
              Corrected typo causing the driver to assume that ASF is always enabled.
              Changed the restart autonegociation routine to take into account the
              changes made in v6.65

      Impact:
              These changes affect all adapters in all versions of Windows.


Version 6.67 June 13, 2003
-------------------------

   Enhancements:
   =============
   1. Request:
               Increment version number for revision control purposes.

      Change:
               Changed version number from 6.66 to 6.67

      Impact:
               None.


Version 6.66 June 02, 2003
-------------------------

   Fixes:
   =======

   1. Problem:
              CQ7927: System locks up when driver is unloaded on 5700/5701 with ASF.

      Cause:
              A workaround that is not applicable to the 5700 and 5701 related to
              nvram accesses was being executed which caused an access to a invalid
              register.

      Change:
              Qualified the asf and nvram access workaround to be executed on only
              non 5700 and 5701 parts.

      Impact:
              This change only affects 5700 and 5701.



Version 6.65 May 31, 2003
-------------------------

   Fixes:
   =======

   1. Problem:
              CQ7874,7873: Cannot get link after disabling power saving mode
              with ReverseNway. Cannot get link after changing from 100mb switch
              to 10mb hub.

      Cause:
              There was a corner case in the ReverseNway logic that was causing
              the phy not advertise correct capabilities when ReverseNway is
              disabled while the control suite has the driver suspended.
              There was a corner case in the ReverseNway logic that was causing
              the to not be reset properly when the phy lockup errata was executed.

      Change:
              Corrected corner cases so the phy advertises correct capabilities to
              it's link partner.

      Impact:
              These changes only affect those platforms that have ReverseNway enabled.

   2. Problem:
              CQ7914: 5700BX fails to pass traffic while running 2c_Simultaneous
              WHQL tests.

      Cause:
              A change in the 6.60 driver to address an errata on the 5704 inadvertently
              broke an existing fix for the 5700_BX small fragment errata. The bug was
              causing the driver to run out of coalesce buffers when run on 5700_BX
              devices.

      Change:
              Corrected code so the driver will properly handle small fragment coalesce
              buffers on 5700_BX devices.

      Impact:
              This change only affects 5700_BX devices. Other devices will not see any
              change in behavior.


Version 6.64 May 20, 2003
-------------------------

   Fixes:
   =======

   1. Problem:
              CQ785207: Device is Yellow Banged out after disable/enable of the
              driver.

      Cause:
              There was a race condition in the halt cpu routine in which the
              halted cpu could still be holding the NVRAM arbitration bit.
              This was preventing the driver from reading the configuration
              information from the NVRAM and caused the driver to unload.

      Change:
              Added check in the halt cpu routine to see if the halted cpu is
              holding the NVRAM arbitration bit.

      Impact:
              None


Version 6.63 May 20, 2003
-------------------------

   1. Enhancements:

   Fixes:
   =======

   1. Problem:
              CQ7807: Loopback- - Mac test fails

      Cause:
              The driver was not correctly configuring the 5705 for mac loopback
              if the device was linked at 10mb.

      Change:
              Changed code to correctly configure the device when linked at 10mb.

      Impact:
              None

   2. Problem:
              CQ7827: System will freeze on shutdown when linked at 10mb half.

      Cause:
              The phy was getting powered down during reset.

      Change:
              Changed code to not power down the phy during reset.

      Impact:
              None

Version 6.62 May 15, 2003
-------------------------

   Fixes:
   =======

   1. Problem:
              CQ7656: Driver get yellow bang on 5788.

      Cause:
              A check for the device/bond id was detecting the 5788 as an
              unsupported device and therefore was causing the driver to unload.

      Change:
              Removed the check that was causing the driver to unload.

      Impact:
              None

   2. Problem:
              CQ7798, CQ7799: ChkInf found errors in the inf files.

      Cause:
              Typos in the inf files.

      Change:
              Corrected the inf files.

      Impact:
              None

   3. Problem:
              The workaround for the phy lockup errata was not being applied to all
              versions of the 5703 and 5704.
      Cause:
              There was a check for previous revisions of 5703 and 5704 that was
              incorrectly carried over from a previous errata.

      Change:
              Removed check for specific versions of the 5703 and 5704 for the phy
              lockup errata.

      Impact:
              None


   1. Enhancements:
              CQ7795, CQ7800: 1000 Full Duplex option in adapter advanced properties
              for all inf files.

      Change:
              This option is suppose to be present in only inf files for specific
              OEMs. Removed 1000 Full Duplex option from files that are not applicable.

      Impact:
              None


Version 6.61 May 14, 2003
-------------------------

   Fixes:
   =======

   1. Problem:
         CQ7777: Some of the OID tests are failing in win98me

      Cause:
              Added parameter checks in the OID processing are not
              valid in all cases. These were added in rev 6.54

      Change:
              Removed the checks, they do not work for all cases as implemented.

      Impact:
              None

   2. Problem:
         The driver did not restart autoneg on Fast Ethernet only parts when resuming
         from hibernate or standby.

      Cause:
              This was originally intended behavior. However the driver needs to
              restart autoneg on resume due to phy lockup errata.

      Change:
              During resume check for Fast Ethernet only capable parts and
              restart phy auto negotiation.

      Impact:
              None

   1. Enhancements:
              The following OEM device ID's are not in the inf files.
                PCI\VEN_14e4&DEV_16c7&SUBSYS_00ca0e11
                PCI\VEN_14e4&DEV_16c7&SUBSYS_00cb0e11

      Change:
              Added OEM device ID's

      Impact:
              None

Version 6.60 May 12, 2003
-------------------------

   Fixes:
   =======

   1. Problem:
               Fixed problem with link getting dropped when shutting down Windows
               when using a 5703/2 with old versions of bootcode when OOB WOL is
               enabled.
      Cause:
               The bootcode was not properly passing configuration information to
               the ndis driver.
      Change:
               Modified the ndis driver to read the configuration information directly
               from NVRAM.
      Impact:
               None

   2. Problem:
               System bluescreens with random bugcheck values on .Net with 5704.
      Cause:
               A bug in the 4gb errata workaround with LSO enabled was causing buffer
               overruns which would corrupt system memory and cause random bugcheck values.
      Change:
               Allocated static double copy buffers for use with LSO and 4gb aligned
               buffers.
      Impact:
               None


Version 6.59 May 5, 2003
-------------------------

   Fixes:
   =======

   1. Problem:
               CQ7664: New HP device IDs need to be added.
      Cause:
               N/A
      Change:
               Added HP device IDs to NIC .inf
      Impact:
               None

   2. Problem:
               CQ7521: Mac loopback test is broken with fiber devices
      Cause:
               UM_AutogRetryTimerFunction() calls LM_SetupPhy() during test
      Change:
               Added LM_REQUESTED_MEDIA_TYPE_LOOPBACK condition to call to
               LM_SetupPhy()
      Impact:
               None

   3. Problem:
               The driver will intermittently load with a zero mac address.
      Cause:
               The shared memory area that contains the mac address was not properly
               initialized when the nic is in certain low power modes.
      Change:
               Read the mac address from the NVRAM and not shared memory.
      Impact:
               None

Version 6.58 May 1, 2003
-------------------------

   Fixes:
   =======

   1. Problem:
               Laurel PING -t gets 20-30% 'request timed out' on both ports (CQ7586)

      Cause:
               Fiber phy setup is being performed every half second because we are using
               the autoneg bit as a condition. This bit is not set when the fiber switch
               is not doing autoneg.
      Change:
               Only look at the autoneg bit when autoneg was successfully completed.
      Impact:
               None

   2. Problem:
               Hardy having link status inconsistency (CQ7550)

      Cause:
               Fiber Phy was not programmed properly.
      Change:
               Changed the NDIS code to behave like the Linux code.
      Impact:
               None



Version 6.57 April 29, 2003
-------------------------

   Fixes:
   ========
   1. Problem:
               When the phy is poweredd down via BMAPI the network icon in the system
               tray does not always show link down.
      Cause:
               Race condition between the trying to indicate link down to the operating
               system and the phy reset routine trying to indicate link up to the operating
               system
      Change:
               Corrected logic error to remove race condition.
      Impact:
               None.

   2. Problem:
               The OID OID_GEN_TRANSMIT_QUEUE_LENGTH does not support 64bit queries.
      Cause:
               The code did not support 64bit queries.
      Change:
               Corrected code to support 64bit queries.
      Impact:
               None.

   3. Problem:
               Updated phy workarounds for potential intermittent link problems for 5704/5705.
      Cause:
               Not applicable.
      Change:
               Not applicable.
      Impact:
               None.


Version 6.56 April 18, 2003
-------------------------

   Fixes:
   ========
   1. Problem:
               The phy workaround implemented in 6.55 was not properly qualified to
               be applied to only 5704.
      Cause:
               An 'if' statement was missing when the code was checked in.
      Change:
               Added 'if' statement in routine with 5704 phy workaround to properly
               qualify the workaround.
      Impact:
               None.

Version 6.55 April 17, 2003
-------------------------

   Fixes:
   ========
   1. Problem: CQ #7454, CQ #7559, CQ #7352, CQ #7453, CQ #7500, CQ7469
               Incorrect and intermittent WakeOnLan behavior on 5788. System waking up when
               not configured to wake and system not waking up when configured to wake.
      Cause:
               Ndis driver was not allowing enough time for the bootcode to complete
               execution of it's second phase of boot before communicating WakeOnLan
               configuration information to the bootcode.
      Change:
               Extended max delay for the driver to wait for bootcode to complete execution
               by 60ms.
      Impact:
               Driver unloads will take 60ms longer to execute.

   2. Problem:
               Ndis Driver takes too long to initialize
      Cause:
               The ndis driver had a lengthy delay routine are part of phy initialization
      Change:
               The wait loop was qualified so it only applies to 5700 and 5701. Those parts
               were observed to require this delay.
      Impact:
               Ndis driver initialization should be faster by more than 20ms.

   3. Problem:
               5704 intermittently will not auto-neg link at 1gb.
      Cause:
               The phy has a errata that requires the driver to check if the dfe is
               locked up.
      Change:
               Added dfe lockup check routine as part of the phy reset routine.
      Impact:
               Slightly higher cpu utilization when the cable is first disconnected.

   Enhancements:
   =============
   1. Request:
               Added support for dynamic 10/100 or 10/100/1000 phy auto-neg advertising
               for certain platforms.

      Change:
               Added a check for the state of GPIO2 during link change events and adjust
               auto-neg capability advertising accordingly.

      Impact:
               None.

Version     Release Date

        b.  Always enable OOB WakeOnLan for legacy 5701 bootcode.

6.52        03/14/03
        a.  Added support for 5788.
        b.  Fixed problem with link down being reported if link was acquired during
            driver initialization.

6.51        03/13/03
        a.  Extended wait for link up during resume from Standby/Hibernation to
            fix packet drop issue in WHQL Standby/Hibernate testing.

6.50        03/10/03
        a.  Added 5704S support back in.

6.36

            device is sharing an interrupt.
        b.  Added support for OID_GEN_TRANSMIT_QUEUE_LENGTH
        c.  Corrected support for legacy bootcode that doesn't support eeprom
            version information. This problem was causing WakeOnLan configuration
            problems.
        d.  Fixed problem where serdes adapters were being treated as copper.
        e.  Fixed WHQL failure due to not waiting for link long enough on
            5702/3-A3 parts.
        f.  Fixed ASF hanging when system is going to standby/hibernate.

6.34        02/17/03
        a.  Added code to wait for the 2nd phase of bootcode to complete on
            5702/3/4/5. This resolves a WoL related issue with older
            v2.21a 5703 bootcode, and is generally "safer".  This also
            resolves an unwanted case where WoL was accidentally enabled.
        b.  Removed code to stop the TX and RX processor clocks on 5704
            when going into standby/hibernate or shutdown.  This resolved a
            hang when coming out of S1 with a 5704.
        c.  Minor change to interrupt coalescing algorithm.

6.33        02/14/03

            having the system stay at 10mb when the system is resumed.
        e.  Incorporated improved power management for 5704 when the
            system is being shutdown or put into standby.

6.32        02/12/03
        a.  Updated driver send packets for resolve of Appletalk issue.
        b.  Updated driver for 5704 Fiber Auto Negotiation.
        c.  Added ODI_GEN_PROTOCOL_OPTIONS back into NdisQueryInformation
            because the WHQL tester expects it.
        d.  Fixed problem with NdisQueryInformation returning failure status
            when it's not appropriate.
        e.  Corrected removing 5782 Ethernet@WireSpeed option for WinXp.
        f.  Changed driver to runt tx frames with zero instead of garbage.

6.31        02/10/03
        a.  Removed OID_GEN_PROTOCOL_OPTIONS from NdisQueryInformation
        b.  Removed Ethernet@WireSpeed option from 5705A2/A3 and 5782.
        c.  Added check for null pointers in NdisQueryInformation to prevent
            system blue screens.
        d.  Fixed CQ#5069: Added HotPlug PCI port number assignment.


6.30        02/07/03

        a.  Enabled 5704 Fiber Support for resolve of bugs:
             CQ#6288: BCM5704SA40 Fails to Negotiate with HP Procurve 2524 Switch.
             CQ#6725: Port 1 on 5704s Fiber does not pass traffic.
             CQ#6746: Fiber fails to link w/ 5.27 NDIS driver.
        b.  Added check to allow only valid mac addresses when the user manually
            overrides the mac address.
        c.  Fixed problem with ClkRun signal always being forced to active.

6.14        01/30/03

        a.  Fixed CQ#6800: 5704C Copy/compare test failure in .NET.  The failure
            was a result of unintentionally including the CQ#6381 fix in the
            .NET driver.


6.13        01/30/03
        a.  Fixed CQ#6247:  Under a heavy traffic environment, the driver could
            miss a status block update causing the chip to stall.  This problem
            has been observed only in the 2c_performanceblast Ndistest.

        b.  Fix CQ#6796 Window Diag fails on Internal Memory test on 5700-LOM
             by using alternate method to access memory.


6.12        01/27/03
        a.  Improved LSO firmware load time by not acquiring NVRAM lock.
        b.  Fix CQ6796 Window Diag fails on Internal Memory test on 5700-LOM
             by using alternate method to access memory.


6.11        01/24/03
        a.  Fixed buffer overrun problem when jumbo frames is enabled.
        b.  Fixed interrupt storm if a spurious interrupt occurs after resume
            from standby/hibernate due to stale status block information.
        c.  Fixed 2m_strss test failure due to late status block update during
            heavy bus traffic.
        d.  Fixed WOL failure when cable is disconnected when the system is
            put to sleep.
        e.  Fixed CQ6710 Running window Diag on 5700 LOM causes server to hang
        f.  Fixed CQ6736 BACS Window diagnostic failed on the internal memory test
            by using alternate method to access memory.
        g.  Added PHY power down for 5704 devices when WakeOnLan is Disabled.

6.10        01/13/03
        a.  Fixed CQ#6620 -- Driver may corrupt the stack on Windows 2000 if

    "UseSgl" keyword to 1 and it only works on the 5701.


1.36        05/02/01

    Fixed excessive interrupts problem.

    Modified link change dampening algorithm.  Originally, link change
    indications were delayed 1-2 seconds.  Now, link down indication is
    immediate and link up indication is delayed 1.5 seconds.

    Changed the driver description in the resource file to "Broadcom NetXtreme
    Gigabit Ethernet".

    Added "DpcLoopCnt" configurable parameter for capping DPC looping.


1.35        04/25/01

    Enhance the configurability of determining link change interrupt.  Added
    the following configurable parameters:

        "PhyIntMode"
            0   Auto select link change interrupt (default).
            1   Link change is triggered by the PHY interrupt.
            2   Link change is determined from the link ready signal.
            3   Link change is determined by auto-polling.  (5701 only)

            The default mode for 5700 is "1" and 5701 is "2".

        "LinkChngMode"
            0   Auto select the mechanism for determining link change status.
            1   Look at the MAC status register to get link change status.
            2   Look at the status block for link change status.  (5701 only).

            The default mode for 5700 is "1" and 5701 is "2".

        "Bcm540xMode"
            0   Auto select 540x LED mode based on the device's subsystem IDs.
            1   540x LED mode is set to "Triple Speed".
            2   540x LED mode is set to "LINK10".

    On the 5701, the status block size is configured to 80, 64, or 32 bytes
    long depending on the number of rings enabled.

    Modified code to adjust the start of a receive buffer so that the payload
    will align at a 4-byte boundary.

    Modified b57w2k.inf to allow for generic installation.  The driver will
    check for supported devices and will fail if an unknown device is detected.

    Fixed the following issues:
        a.  No link up event after a PHY loopback test.


1.34        04/16/01

    Added support for the Agilent and BCM8002 SERDES (fiber boards).

    Added support for Windows Me and 98.

    Changed the severity of link down event message log to "Information"
    instead of "Error".

    Modified the driver to not log "Informational" messages to the EventViewer
    during initialization.  On a Windows 9x system, this will cause an
    undesirable error message box to popup after the system boots up.  This
    version of the driver will not log "Driver initialized successfully"
    message and link information during initialization.

    Added support for the new Fiber board with the BCM8002 SERDES.

    Enable LLC_LENGTH check when VLAN is not enabled.

    Added the "Dribble Bit" workaround.

    was cause by the driver copying network wake-up frame beyond the give
    buffer.

    Added a workaround for the problem with not being able to DMA buffers that
    end at 0xfffffff8-0xffffffff address region.

    Driver will not switch to the auxilliary power if the system does not have
    it.

    Disallowed receiving packets bigger than 1514 but less than 1536 when
    jumbo frame is not enabled.

    network.


1.22        12/09/00

    Fixed 1c_gtime failure when forcing 10mb full duplex on an HP 2424M switch.


1.21        12/07/00

    Shorten "Link Selection" items in b57w2k.inf and oemsetup.inf.

    Added software workaround to recover from link mismatch settings.  For
    example, the link partner is forced to 100mb and the adapter is forced
    to 10mb.


1.19        12/04/00

    Replaced "Driver" with "Controller" in b57w2k.inf and oemsetup.inf.

    Fixed a very intermitten MAC and PHY loopback failure.


1.18        12/01/00

    Removed TxMtu configurable parameter.  Now the user only has to configure
    RxMtu to enable jumbo frame support.

    5401 B0 silicon was not being resetted when the 1gb link went down.  The
    reset is required as software workaround for the 5401 errata.

    Driver will now restore a couple of PCI configuration registers after
    a reset.


1.17        11/29/00

    Added the ability to configure jumbo frame parameter in the b57w2k.inf.

    Fixed driver reporting wrong link status after reboot when forcing
    link speed on both sides.

    Fixed failure in MAC loopback test.


1.16        11/28/00

    Updated the 5401 tap power-management script.

    Removed the busy polling for link when unplugging the cable.  The polling
    period was too long and it was causing BASP to drop some Chariot
    connections.

    Removed support for A0, A1 silicon to reduce code size.


1.15        11/26/00

    Fixed intermitten system lock-up on shutdown when WOL is enabled.

    Multicast table was never cleared which was causing the intermitten
    failure in 2c_rmult.

    5401 reset on link down should occur only when the current speed is 1gb.

    Reduced driver load/unload time which will eliminate the 1c_gtime warnings.
    However, these warnings may still occur when WOL is enabled.  This is due
    to the driver waiting for auto-negotiation to complete before completing
    initialization.


1.14        11/22/00

    Added a software workaround for the 5401 to prevent it from locking up
    when the cable is unplugged during transmission.

    All the LEDs now indicate their corresponding link speed.


1.13        11/21/00

    Fixed problem with TCP connections dropping when running Chariot in
    10/100mb mode.

    Fixed problem with the adapter being disabled after exiting from the
    standby mode in Windows 2000.

    Fixed problem with the adapter not entering into wake-up mode when
    "shutdown".

    Ignore TX checksum parameter for B0 silicon.


1.12        11/18/00

    Added WOL support for Windows 2000.

    Fixed intermitten lock-up in 10mb mode.  Shadowed several MAC registers.

    Fixed PHY register read problem.  Occasionally PHY register read returned
    an incorrect value.

    Default TaskOffload and FlowControl parameter to off.


0.9         11/10/00

    Added MagicPacket support.

    In v0.8, whenever the driver detects a link mismatch, it will recover
    by switching to auto-negotiation mode.  This version does not have this
    recovery mechanism.

    Write the link settings to the EventLog after the driver has initialized.

    Fixed 1c_gtime failure when forcing line speed.


0.8         11/03/00

    NdisPacket allocated by the driver did not have the protocol reserved
    area which could cause system crash.

    Added a better handshaking mechanism with the firmware.

    Fixed the 2m_addres test.

    Added Compaq Hot Plug PCI support in oemsetup.inf.

    The MAC was not properly setup to operate in half duplex mode.

    Modified the driver to receive maximum sized VLAN packet without using
    the Jumbo receive ring.


0.7         10/30/00

    Fixed problems with forcing line speed.

    Added checksum offloading capability.

    Fixed several issues with the Ndis test.  The following test should
    pass now:  1c_ofldn, 2m_load, 2m_misc, 2m_addre.

    Added support for IBM hot plug.


0.6         10/22/00

    Fixed lock-up that occurs when running the Ndis stress test.

    Fixed system crash when stopping the driver on an A1 silicon.

    Minor changes in b57nt4.hlp.

    Fixed problems with PHY loopback.  Added support for MAC loopback.

    Added a vendor specific OID for changing the MAC address.

    Tested VLAN tagging and 802.1p priority packet.


0.5         10/17/00

    Added a timer routine to periodically program the hardware to update
    the status block and generate an interrupt.  This is necessary because
    with A0, A1, B0 silicon, under certain condition, the host will miss
    interrupts.

    Disable PCI NWI by default.

    The send producer index is written twice.  This is a bug in the A0, A1, B0
    silicon in which chip will miss the mailbox stimulus.

    Added tx/rx PAUSE frame negotiation with link partner.  Modified b57w2k.inf
    to allow the user to configure rx/tx PAUSE frame independently.

    Fixed VLAN bug.  The driver was retrieving VLAN tag from the wrong offset
    in the miniport reserved area.

    Added jumbo frame support.  The user must manually modify the registry
    parameter to enable this feature.  "RxJumboDescCnt" must be changed
    to some value greater than 20 but less than 256.  This value determine
    the numbe of receive buffers to allocate for jumbo frames.

    Modified oemsetup.inf and b57w2k.inf to default "DisableAutoNeg" to 1,
    which will disable auto-negotiation advertisement when selecting a
    particular line speed.

    Added a help file for b57nt4.sys driver.


0.04        10/02/00
    Added support for link change detection via PHY interrupt as oppose to
    having the MAC poll the PHY.  PHY interrupt processing can be enable
    via "UsePhyInterrupt" registry parameter.  Default is "auto-polling".

    Miscellaneous modifications oemsetup.inf and b57w2k.inf.  Also fixed
    driver update issues with oemsetup.inf.

    Added delay before the driver is unloaded to prevent W2K from detecting
    the card as a different device.

    Fixed the deserialized driver to queue outgoing packets when there is no
    more packet descriptors left.


0.03        09/21/00
    Modified reset and halt routines to handle shutdown more robustly.  Some
    systems will not recognize the board after a warm boot.  This version
    of the driver should fix this.


0.02        09/09/00
    Initial release for the A1 silicon.
