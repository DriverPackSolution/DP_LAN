       Windows will auto-detect your new adapter, and the "New Hardware Found"
       dialogue box will appear. Select "Driver from disk provided by hardware
       manufacturer" to install driver from the diskette that comes with your
       LAN adapter.

    2. Insert the driver diskette into your floppy drive, and specify the
       path of the driver in the diskette(i.e. A:\) to copy the driver
       files to your system.
